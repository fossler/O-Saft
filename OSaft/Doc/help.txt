NAME

        O-Saft - OWASP SSL advanced forensic tool
                 OWASP SSL audit for testers


DESCRIPTION

        This tools lists  information  about remote target's  SSL certificate
        and tests the remote target according given list of ciphers.

        Note:  Throughout this description  '$0'  is used as an alias for the
        program name  'o-saft.pl'.


SYNOPSIS

        $0 [COMMANDS ..] [OPTIONS ..] target [target target ...]

        where  [COMMANDS]  and  [OPTIONS]  are described below  and target is
        a hostname either as full qualified domain name or as IP address.
        Multiple commands and targets may be combined.

        All  commands  and  options  can also be specified in a  rc-file, see
        RC-FILE  below.

        I.g. all commands start with a  '+'  character and options start with
        '-'  or  '--'  characters. Anything else is treated as target name.


QUICKSTART

        Before going into  a detailed description  of the  purpose and usage,
        here are some examples of the most common use cases:

        * Show supported (enabled) ciphers of target:
          $0 +cipher --enabled example.tld

        * Show supported (enabled) ciphers with their DH parameters:
          $0 +cipher-dh example.tld

        * Test all ciphers, even if not supported by local SSL implementation:
          $0 +cipherall example.tld

        * Show details of certificate and connection of target:
          $0 +info example.tld

        * Check certificate, ciphers and SSL connection of target:
          $0 +check example.tld

        * Check connection to target for vulnerabilities:
          $0 +vulns example.tld

        * Check for all known ciphers (independant of SSL library):
          $0 +cipherraw example.tld --range=full
          checkAllCiphers.pl example.tld
          checkAllCiphers.pl example.tld --range=full --v

        * Get the certificate's Common Name for a bunch of servers:
          $0 +cn example.tld some.tld other.tld

        * List more usage examples
          $0 --help=examples

        * List all available commands:
          $0 --help=commands

        * Get table of contents for complete help
          $0 --help=toc

        * Show just one section, for example SECURITY, from help
          $0 --help=SECURITY

        * Start the simple GUI
          o-saft.tcl

        * Start the simple GUI which uses $0 in a Docker image
          o-saft.tcl --docker

        For more specialised test cases, refer to the sections  COMMANDS  and
        OPTIONS  below. For more examples please refer to  EXAMPLES  section.

        For more details, please see  X&Requirements&  and  INSTALLATION  below.


WHY?

        Why a new tool for checking SSL security and configuration when there
        are already a dozen or more such good tools in existence (in 2012)?

        Unique features:
          * working in closed environments, i.e. without internet connection
          * checking availability of ciphers independent of installed library
          * checking for all possible ciphers (up to 65535 per SSL protocol)
          * mainly same results on all platforms.

        Currently available tools suffer from some or all of following issues:
          * lack of tests of unusual SSL certificate configurations
          * may return different results for the same checks on given target
          * missing tests for modern SSL/TLS functionality
          * missing tests for specific, known SSL/TLS vulnerabilities
          * no support for newer, advanced, features e.g. CRL, OCSP, EV
          * limited capability to create your own customised tests

        Other  reasons or problems  are that other tools are either binary or
        use additional binaries and hence are not portable to other platforms.

        In contrast to (all?) most other tools, including  openssl(1), it can
        be used to "ask simple questions" like "does target support STS" just
        by calling:
          $0 +hsts_sts example.tld

        For more, please see  EXAMPLES  section below.
        If it should run on systems with old software (perl or perl modules),
        please see  DEBUG  section below.


SECURITY

        This tool is designed to be used by people doing security or forensic
        analyses. Hence no malicious input is expected.

        There are no special security checks implemented. Some parameters are
        roughly sanatised according unwanted characters.  In particular there
        are no checks according any kind of code injection.

        Care should be taken, when additional tools and modules are installed
        as described in  INSTALLATION  below.  In particular  we recommend to
        do such installations into directoies specially prepared for use with
        $0 . No other tools of your system should use these installations
        i.e. by accident or because your environment variables point to them.

        Note that compilation and installation of additional tools  (openssl,
        Net::SSLeay, etc.) uses known insecure configurations and features!
        This is essential to make $0 able to check for such insecurities.

        It is  highly recommended to do these installations and use the tools
        on a separate testing system.

        DO NOT USE THESE INSTALLATIONS ON PRODUCTIVE SYTEMS.


CONCEPTS

        The purpose of ''O-Saft'' is to do the work, not to force the user to
        learn a new tool or to install "newer" software first.
        However, the user "should do something" if necessary depending on the
        reported results.

        ... more comming soon ...


TECHNICAL INFORMATION

        It is important to understand, which provided information is based on
        data returned by underlaying (used) libraries and the information
        computed directly.

    OpenSSL, libssl, libcrypto

        In general the tool uses perl's  Net::SSLeay(1)  module  which itself
        is based on libssl and/or libssleay library of the operating system.
        It's possible to use other versions of these libraries, see options:
          * --exe-path=PATH --exe=PATH
          * --lib-path=PATH --lib=PATH
          * --envlibvar=NAME

        The external  openssl(1)  is called to extract  some information from
        its output.  The version of openssl can be controlled  with following
        options:
          * --openssl=TOOL
          * --no-openssl
          * --force-openssl
          * --exe-path=PATH --exe=PATH

        Above applies to all commands except  +cipherall and +cipherraw which
        uses no other libraries.

        OpenSSL is recommended to be used for libssl and libcrypto.  Versions
        0.9.8k to 1.0.2e (Jan. 2016) are known to work. However, versions be-
        for 1.0.0 may not provide all informations.
        LibreSSL is not recommended, because  some functionallity  considered
        insecure, has been removed.
        For more details, please see  INSTALLATION  below.


    Certificates and CA

        All checks according the validity of the certificate chain  are based
        on the root CAs installed on the system. NOTE that Net::SSLeay(1) and
        openssl(1)  may have their own rules where to find the root CAs.
        Please refer to the documentation on your system for these tools.
        However, there are folloing options to tweak these rules:
          * --ca-file=FILE
          * --ca-path=DIR
          * --ca-depth=INT

    Commands and options

        All arguments  starting with  '+'  are considered  COMMANDS  for this
        tool. All arguments starting with  '--'  are considered  OPTIONS  for
        this tool.

        Reading any data from STDIN or here-documents is not yet supported.
        It's reserved for future use.

    Environment variables

        Following environment variables are incorporated:
          * LD_LIBRARY_PATH - used and extended with definitions from options
          * OPENSSL         - if set, full path to openssl executable
          * OPENSSL_CONF    - if set, full path to openssl's openssl.cnf or
                              directory where to find openssl.cnf
#         * OPENSSL_FIPS    -
#         * OPENSSL_ENGINES -
#         * OPENSSL_ALLOW_PROXY
#         * OPENSSL_ALLOW_PROXY_CERTS


    Requirements

        For checking all ciphers and all protocols with  +cipherall  command,
        just perl (5.x) without any modules is required.

        For  +info  and  +check  (and all related) commands,  perl (5.x) with
        following modules (minimal version) is recommended:

          * IO               1.25 (2011)
          * IO::Socket::INET 1.37 (2011)
          * IO::Socket::SSL  1.90 (2013)
          * Net::DNS         0.66 (2011)
          * Net::SSLeay      1.49 (2012)

        However, it is recommended to use the most recent version of the mod-
        ules which then gives more accurate results and less warnings. If the
        modules are missing, they can be installed i.e. with:

              cpan Net::SSLeay

        Note: if you want to use advanced features of openssl or Net::SSLeay,
        please see  INSTALLTION  section how to compile and install the tools
        fully customized.

        Also an openssl executable should be available, but is not mandatory.

        For checking DH parameters of ciphers, openssl 1.0.2  or newer should
        be available. If an older version of openssl is found, we try hard to
        extract  the DH parameters from the  data returned by the server, see
        +cipher-dh  command.

        If you need to run on systems with older perl or perl module versions
        please refer to the  DEBUG  section for more inofrmation.


RESULTS

        All output is designed to be easily parsed by postprocessors.  Please
        see  OUTPUT  section below for details.

        For the results,  we have to distinguish  those  returned by  +cipher
        command  and those from  all other tests and checks like   +check  or
        +info  command.

      +cipher

          The cipher checks will return  one line for each  tested cipher. It
          contains at least the cipher name,  'yes'  or  'no'  whether  it is
          supported or not, and a security qualification. It may look like:
              AES256-SHA       yes    HIGH
              NULL-SHA         no     weak

          Depending on the used  --legacy=*  option the format may differ and
          also contain more information.  For details see  --legacy=*  option
          below.

          The text for security qualifications are (mainly) those returned by
          openssl (version 1.0.1): LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH and WEAK.
          The same texts, but with all lower case characters, are used if the
          qualification was adapted herein. Following rules for adjusting the
          qualification were used:

            * weak:
              ** all *NULL* ciphers
              ** all *RC2* and  *RC4*  ciphers
              ** all *EXPORT*  ciphers
              ** all *anon* (aka ADH aka DHA) ciphers
              ** all *CBC* and *CBC3* (aka 3DES) and DES ciphers
            * low:
            * high:
              ** all *AES(128|256)* ciphers
              ** all *CAMELLIA* ciphers

      +check

          These tests return a line with  a label  describing the test  and a
          test result for it. The  idea is to report  'yes'  if the result is
          considered "secure"  otherwise report  'no'  followed by the reason
          why it's considered insecure. Example of a check considered secure:
              Label of the performed check:           yes

          Example of a check considered insecure:
              Label of the performed check:           no (reason why)

          Note  that there are tests where the results  appear confusing when
          first viewed, like for www.wi.ld:
              Certificate is valid according given hostname:  no (*.wi.ld)
              Certificate's wildcard does not match hostname: yes

          This can for example occur with:
              Certificate Common Name:                *.wi.ld
              Certificate Subject's Alternate Names:  DNS:www.wi.ld

          Please check the result with the  +info  command also to  verify if
          the check sounds reasonable.

      +info

          The test result contains detailed information. The labels there are
          mainly the same as for the  +check  command.


COMMANDS

        There are commands for various tests according the  SSL connection to
        the target, the targets certificate and the used ciphers.

        All commands are preceded by a  '+'  to easily distinguish from other
        arguments and options. However, some --OPTIONS options are treated as
        commands for historical reason or compatibility to other programs.

        The most important commands are (in alphabetical order):
          +check +cipher +info +http +list +quick +sni +sni_check +version

        A list of all available commands will be printed with:
          $0 --help=cmd

        The description of all other commands will be printed with:
          $0 --header --help=commands

        The summary and internal commands return requested information or the
        results of checks. These are described below.

        Note that some commands may be a combination of other commands, see:
          $0 --header --help=intern

        The following sub-sections only describe the commands,  which do more
        than giving a simple information from the target.  All other commands
        can be listed with:
          $0 --header --help=commands

        The final sub-sections  X&Notes about commands&  describes some notes
        about special commands and related commands.


    Commands for information about this tool

        All these commands will exit after execution (cannot be used together
        with other commands).

      +ciphers

          Show ciphers offered by local SSL implementation.

          This commands prints the ciphers in a format like "openssl ciphers"
          does. It also accepts the  -v  and  -V  option. The  --legacy=TYPE
          option can be used as described for  +list  command.
          Use  +list  command for more information according ciphers.

      +list

          Show all ciphers supported by this tool. This includes cryptogrphic
          details of the cipher and some internal details about the rating.

          In contrast to the  +ciphers  command,  +list  uses  TAB characters
          instead of spaces to seperate columns.  It also prints table header
          lines by default.

          Different output formats are used for the  --legacy  option:
            * --legacy=simple   tabular output of cipher values
            * --legacy=full     as --legacy=simple but more data
            * --legacy=openssl  output like with +ciphers command
            * --legacy=ssltest  output like "ssltest --list"

#          Use  --v  option to show more details.
# seit 15.01.07 nicht mehr benutzt

      +VERSION

          Just show version and exit.

      +version

          Show version information for both the program and the  Perl modules
          that it uses, then exit.

          Use  --v  option to show more details.

      +libversion

          Show version of openssl.

      +quit

          Show internal data and exit, used for debugging only.

    Commands to check SSL details
#
#       Check for SSL connection in  SNI mode and if given  FQDN  matches
#       certificate's subject.

        Following (summary and internal) commands are simply a shortcut for a
        list of other commands. For details of the list use:
              $0 --help=intern

      +check

          Check the SSL connection for security issues. Implies  +cipher .

      +host

          Print details about the targets hostname, DNS, etc.
          These details are usually printed only for the  +check  and  +info
          command, but not for any individual command.

      +http

          Perform HTTP checks (like STS, redirects etc.).

      +info

          Overview of most important details of the SSL connection.

          Use  --v  option to show details also, which span multiple lines.

      +info--v

          Overview of all details of the SSL connection. It is a shortcut for
          all commands listed below but not including  +cipher.

          This command is intended for debugging as it prints some details of
          the used  Net::SSLinfo  module.

      +quick

          Quick overview of checks. Implies  --enabled  and  --short.

      +pfs

          Check if servers offers ciphers with prefect forward secrecy (PFS).

      +protocols

          Check for protocols supported by target.

      +vulns

          Check for various vulnerabilities.

      +sts
      +hsts

          Various checks according STS HTTP header.
          This option implies  --http,  means that  --no-http is ignored.

      +sni

          Check for Server Name Indication (SNI) usage.

      +sni_check
      +check_sni

          Check for Server Name Indication (SNI) usage  and  validity  of all
          names (CN, subjectAltName, FQDN, etc.).

      +bsi

          Various checks according BSI TR-02102-2 and TR-03116-4 compliance.

      +ev

          Various checks according certificate's extended Validation (EV).

          Hint: use option  --v --v  to get information about failed checks.

      +sizes

          Check length, size and count of some values in the certificate.

      +s_client

          Dump data retrieved from  "openssl s_client ..."  call. This should
          be used for debugging only.
          It can be used just like openssl itself, for example:
              openssl s_client -connect host:443 -no_sslv2

      +dump

          Dumps internal data for SSL connection and target certificate. This
          is mainly for debugging and  should not be used together with other
          commands (except +cipher).
          Each key-value pair is enclosed in  #{  and  #} .

          Using  --trace --trace  dumps data of  Net::SSLinfo  too.

      +exec

          Command used internally when requested to use other libraries.
          This command should not be used directly.


    Commands to test ciphers provided by target

          Beside the description of the commands itself here, please see also
          X&Notes about commands&  below.

      +cipher

          Check target for ciphers,  either all ciphers, or ciphers specified
          with  --cipher=*  option.

          Note that ciphers not supported by the local SSL implementation are
          not checked by default, use  +cipherall or +cipherraw   command.

          Use  --v  option to see all ciphers being checked.

      +cipherraw

          Check target for all possible ciphers.
          Does not depend on local SSL implementation.

          In contrast to  +cipher  this command has some options to tweak the
          cipher tests, connection results and some strange behaviours of the
          target. See  X&Options for cipherall command&  for details.

      +cipherall

          Same as  +cipherraw  but ouput format similar to  +cipher  command.

      +cipher-default

          Lists the cipher selected by the server for each protocol sometimes
          referred to as "default cipher".

          For each protocol the two selected ciphers are shown,  one returned
          by the server if the cipher list in the  ClientHello is sorted with
          the strongest cipher first, and one returned  if the cipher list in
          the ClientHello is sorted with strongest cipher last.
          See  X&Notes about commands&  for details.

      +cipher-dh

          Checked target for ciphers. All ciphers supported by the server are
          printed with their DH or ECDH paramaters (if available).
          ciphers.

      +null
      +cipher-null

          Check if target accepts NULL ciphers.

      +adh
      +cipher-adh

          Check if target accepts ciphers with anonymous key exchange.

      +export
      +cipher-exp

          Check if target accepts EXPORT ciphers.

      +cbc
      +cipher-cbc

          Check if target accepts CBC ciphers.

      +des
      +cipher-des

          Check if target accepts DES ciphers.

      +cipher-rc4

          Check if target accepts RC4 ciphers.

      +edh
      +cipher-edh

          Check if target supports ephemeral ciphers.

      +cipher-pfs

          Check if target supports ciphers with PFS.

      +cipher-strong

          Check if target selects strongest cipher.

      +cipher-weak

          Check if target selects weak cipher (oposite of  +cipher-strong).

    Notes about commands

      +cipher vs. +cipherall

          +cipher  can only check for ciphers - more precise: cipher suites -
          provided by the local SSL implementation (i.e. libssl).
          +cipherall  can check for any cipher,  as it just uses the cipher's
          integer value in the range 0 .. 65532.

      +cipherall vs. +cipherraw

          These commands are identical, just the output format is different.

      +cipher vs. +cipher-dh

          While  +cipher  prints checked ciphers,  +cipher-dh  prints ciphers
          with their DH or ECDH paramaters (if available)  only for supported
          ciphers.

      +cipher vs. +cipher-default

          Both commands show the default cipher foreach protocol.

          +cipher  lists a summary of ciphers selected by the server for each
          protocol requested by the user (for example by using options like:
          --sslv3 --tlsv1 etc.).  When the  --v  option is used, all selected
          ciphers for all known protocols are listed. This summary focuses on
          counts for various ciphers.

          +cipher-default  lists the  cipher selected  by the server for each
          protocol.

      +cipher-selected vs. +cipher-default

          +selected  lists the cipher selected by the server if no particular
          protocol was specified and the system's default cipher list is send
          in the ClientHello to the server.

          +cipher-default  lists the  cipher selected  by the server for each
          protocol.

# other names: SSLHonorCipherOrder prefer-server-ciphers PreferServerCipherSuites Server-Defined-Cipher-Order
      +cipher-strong vs. +cipher-default

          +strong-cipher  shows the result of the check if strong ciphers are
          preferred by the server. It is a check command.

          +cipher-default  lists the  cipher selected  by the server for each
          protocol. It is a information command.

          It is not possible to check if a server uses 'SSLHonorCipherOrder'.
          Even if it is used (switched on),  it is not possible to  check the
          specified order of the ciphers.

          I. g. it is expected that the order is according the cipher suite's
          strength, meaning the most strongest first, and the weakest last.
          It does not make sense to use an order where a weak cipher preceeds
          a stronger one. Such a (mis-)configuration should be detected.

          Having this in mind, the algorithm to detect a  proper cipher order
          is as simply as follows:
            1. pass sorted cipher list with strongest cipher first
            2. pass sorted cipher list with strongest cipher last
          if the server returns the same cipher for both checks, it's assumed
          that it prefers to use the most strongest cipher. In this case it's
          obvious that 'SSLHonorCipherOrder' is set (exceptions see below).

          +cipherall  uses a  more accurate algorithm  to detect the server's
          cipher order.

          Exceptions:
          If either, the server or the client,  uses only one cipher suite in
          the list, SSLHonorCipherOrder cannot be detected at all.
          The same happens, if only one cipher in the client's list matches a
          cipher in the server's list.

      +extensions vs. +tlsextensions

          +extensions  shows the "Certificate extensions" and  +tlsextensions
          will show the TLS protocol extensions.
          Use  +tlsextdebug  to show more informations about the TLS protocol
          extensions.

      +http2 +spdy +spdy3 +spdy31 +spdy4 +prots

          These commands are just an alias for the  +protocols  command.

      +hostname vs. +wildhost vs. +altname vs. +rfc_2818

          The commands  +cn  and  +altname  print the  information stored  in
          the certificate.
          The command  +hostname  checks if the given hostname matches the CN
          value in the certificate.  Note that wildcard names in the CN, only
          allow to contain one '*'.
          The command  +wildcard  checks if the given hostname does not match
          any name specified in the certificate's "subjectAltname". This check
          is usefull  if the certificate and the configuration must comply to
          RFC 6125 or EV certificates.

    Options for all commands (general)

      --dns

          Do DNS lookups to map given hostname to IP, do a reverse lookup.

      --no-dns

          Do not make DNS lookups.
          Note  that the corresponding IP and reverse hostname may be missing
          in some messages then.

      --host=HOST

          Specify HOST as target to be checked. Legacy option.

      --port=PORT

          Specify PORT of target to be used. Legacy option.

      --host=HOST --port=PORT HOST:PORT HOST

          When giving more than one HOST argument,  the sequence of the given
          HOST argument and the given  --port=PORT  and the given --host=HOST
          options are important.
          The rule how ports and hosts are mapped is as follows:

            HOST:PORT arguments are used as is (connection to HOST on PORT)
            only HOST is given, then previous specified  --port=PORT  is used

          Note that URLs are treated as HOST:PORT, if they contain a port.
          Example:
              $0 +cmd host-1 --port 23 host-2 host-3:42 host-4

          will connect to:
            * host-1:443
            * host-2:23
            * host-3:42
            * host-4:23

      --proxyhost=PROXYHOST --proxy=PROXYHOST:PROXYPORT

          Make all connection to target using PROXYHOST.

          Also possible is: --proxy=PROXYUSER:PROXYPASS@PROXYHOST:PROXYPORT

      --proxyport=PROXYPORT

          Make all connection to target using PROXYHOST:PROXYPORT.

      --proxyuser=PROXYUSER

          Specify username for proxy authentication.

      --proxypass=PROXYPASS

          Specify password for proxy authentication.

      --starttls

          Use 'STARTTLS' command to start a TLS connection via SMTP.
          This option is a shortcut for  --starttls=SMTP .

      --starttls=SMTP
      --starttls=PROT

          Use 'STARTTLS' command to start a TLS connection via protocol. PORT
          PORT may be any of: 'SMTP', 'IMAP', 'IMAP2', 'POP3', 'FTPS', 'RDP',
          'LDAP' or 'XMPP'

          For  --starttls=SMTP  see  --dns-mx  also to use MX records instead
          of host

      --starttls-delay=SEC

          Number of seconds to wait before sending a packet, to slow down the
          'STARTTLS' requests. Default is 0.
          This may prevent blocking of requests by the target due to too much
          or too fast connections.
          Note:  In this case there is an automatic suspension and retry with
          a longer delay.

      --cgi
      --cgi-exec

          Internal use for CGI mode only.

    Options for SSL tool

      --rc

          Read  RC-FILE  if exists, from directory where program was found.

      --no-rc

          Do not read  RC-FILE.

      --exitcode

          The exit status code will be greater 0, if any of following applies:
          * any check returns  'no'
          * insecure protocols are available
          * insecure ciphers are supported
          * ciphers without PFS are supported (disable with --exitcode-cipher)
          In particular, the status code will be the total count of all these
          checks.

          Parts of these checks can be diasabled,  see  --exitcode-*  options
          below.

          Functionality implemented experimental, may change in future.

      --exitcode-no-checks

          Do not count checks with result 'no' for  --exitcode .

      --exitcode-no-low  --exitcode-no-weak  --exitcode-no-medium

          Do not count LOW, WEAK or MEDIUM security ciphers for  --exitcode .

      --exitcode-no-ciphers

          Do not count any ciphers for  --exitcode .

      --exitcode-no-ciphers

          Do not count any ciphers for  --exitcode .

      --exitcode-no-pfs

          Do not count ciphers without PFS for  --exitcode .

      --openssl-s_client --s_client

          Use  "openssl s_slient ..."  call to retrieve more information from
          the SSL connection.  This is disabled by default on Windows because
          of performance problems. Without this option (default on Windows !)
          following informations are missing:
              compression, expansion, renegotiation, resumption,
              selfsigned, verify, chain, protocols, DH parameters

          See  Net::SSLinfo  for details.

          If used together with  --trace, s_client  data will also be printed
          in debug output of  Net::SSLinfo.

      --no-openssl

          Do not use external "openssl"  tool to retrieve information. Use of
          "openssl" is disabled by default on Windows.
          Note that this results in some missing informations, see above.

      --openssl=TOOL

          'TOOL'        can be a path to openssl executable; default: openssl
#         * ssleay:     use installed Net::SSLeay library for perl
#         * x86_32:     use  ** NOT YET IMPLEMENTED **
#         * x86_64:     use  ** NOT YET IMPLEMENTED **
#         * x86Mac:     use  ** NOT YET IMPLEMENTED **
#         * arch:       use  ** NOT YET IMPLEMENTED **

      --openssl-cnf=FILE --openssl-conf=FILE

          'FILE'        path of directory or full path of openssl.cnf

          If set, environment variable OPENSSL_CONF will be set to given path
          (or file) when openssl(1) is started. Please see openssl's man page
          for details about specifying alternate  openssl.cnf  files.

      --openssl-ciphers --force-openssl

          Use openssl to check for supported ciphers;  default: IO::Socket(1)

          This option forces to use  "openssl s_slient -connect CIPHER .." to
          check if a cipher is supported by the remote target. This is useful
          if the  --lib=PATH  option doesn't work (for example due to changes
          of the API or other incompatibilities).

      --exe-path=PATH
      --exe=PATH

          'PATH'        is a full path where to find openssl.

      --lib-path=PATH
      --lib=PATH

          'PATH'        is a full path where to find libssl.so and libcrypto.so

          See X&HACKER's INFO& below for a detailed description how it works.

      --envlibvar=NAME

          'NAME'  is the name of a environment variable containing additional
          paths for searching dynamic shared libraries.
          Default is LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

          Check your system for the proper name, i.e.:
              DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, LIBPATH, RPATH, SHLIB_PATH.

      --ssl-error

          Stop trying to connect to target if  --ssl-error-max  erros occourd
          sequentially, or if the total amount of errors  --ssl-error-total
          is reached.

          The connection to  a target may fail, or even block, due to various
          resons, for example lost network at all, blocking at firewall, etc.
          In particular when checking ciphers with  +cipher , this may result
          in long delays until results are printed.
          Using this option stops trying to do more connections to the target
          when  --ssl-error-max  consecutive errors occoured, or if the total
          amount of errors increases  --ssl-error-total.

          Note that this may result in loss of information and/or checks.
#     --ssl-error-delay=SEC        (default: 0).

      --ssl-error-max=CNT

          Max. amount of consecutive errors (default: 5).

      --ssl-error-timeout=SEC

          Timeout in seconds when a failed connection is treated as error and
          then counted (default: 1).

      --ssl-error-total=CNT

          Max. total amount of errors (default: 10).

      --ssl-lazy

          I.g. this tools tries to identify available functionality according
          SSL versions from the underlaying libraries.  Unsupported  versions
          are then disables and a warning is shown.
          Unfortunately some libraries have  not implemented all functions to
          check availability of a specific SSL version, which then results in
          a compile error.

          This option disables the strict check of availability.
          If the underlaying library doesn't support the required SSL version
          at all, following error may occour:
              Can't locate auto/Net/SSLeay/CTX_v2_new.al in @INC ...

          See X&Note on SSL versions&  for a general note about SSL versions.
          A more detailled description of the problem and how Net::SSLeay be-
          haves, can be found in the source of  $0 ,
          see section starting at
              #| check for supported SSL versions

      --timeout=SEC

          Timeout in seconds when connecting to the target (default: 2).


# following missing on owasp.org 'cause still not fully implemented
      --call=METHOD

          'METHOD'      method to be used for specific functionality

          Available methods:
          * info-socket         use internal socket to retrieve information
          * info-openssl        use external openssl to retrieve information
          * info-user           use usr_getinfo() to retrieve information
          * cipher-socket       use internal socket to ckeck for ciphers
          * cipher-openssl      use external openssl to ckeck for ciphers
          * cipher-user         use usr_getciphers() to ckeck for ciphers

          Method names starting with:
          * info-
            are responsible to retrieve information  about the SSL connection
            and the target certificate (i.e. what the +info command provides)
          * cipher-
            are responsible to connect to the target  and test if it supports
            the specified ciphers  (i.e. what the  +cipher  command provides)
          * check-
            are responsible for performing the checks (i.e. what's shown with
            the  +check  command)
          * score-
            are responsible to compute  the score based on check results

          The second part of the name denotes which kind of method to call:
          * socket      the internal functionality with sockets is used
          * openssl     the exteranl openssl executable is used
          * user        the external special function, as specified in user's
                        o-saft-usr.pm,  is used.

          Example:
              --call=cipher-openssl

          will use the external openssl(1) executable to check the target for
          supported ciphers.

          Default settings are:
              --call=info-socket --call=cipher-socket --call=check-socket

          Just for curiosity, instead of using:
              $0 --call=info-user --call=cipher-user --call=check-user --call=score-user ...

          consider to use your own script like:
              #!/usr/bin/env perl
              usr_getinfo();usr_getciphers();usr_checkciphers();usr_score();

          :-))

      -v

          Print list of ciphers in style like: "openssl ciphers -v".
          Option used with  +ciphers  command only.

      -V

          Print list of ciphers in style like: "openssl ciphers -V".
          Option used with  +ciphers  command only.

    Options for SSL connection to target

      --cipher=CIPHER

          * 'CIPHER'    can be any string accepeted by openssl or following:
          * 'yeast'     use all ciphers from list defined herein, see  +list

          Beside the cipher names accepted by openssl, CIPHER can be the name
          of the constant or the (hex) value as defined in openssl's files.
          Currently supported are the names and constants of openssl 1.0.1k.
          Example:
            * --cipher=DHE_DSS_WITH_RC4_128_SHA
            * --cipher=0x03000066
            * --cipher=66
          will be mapped to   DHE-DSS-RC4-SHA

          Note: if more than one cipher matches, just one will be selected.

          Default is 'ALL:NULL:eNULL:aNULL:LOW' as specified in Net::SSLinfo.

      --socket-reuse

          TCP socket will be reused for  next connection attempt  even if SSL
          connection failed.

      --no-socket-reuse

          Close TCP socket and then reopen for next connection attempt if SSL
          connection failed.

          This is useful for some servers which may return an "TLS alert"  if
          the connection fails and then fail again on the same socket.

      --ignore-no-connect

          A simple check if the target can be connected  will be performed by
          default.  If this check fails, the target will be ignored, means no
          more requested checks will be done.  As this connection check some-
          times fails due to various reasons, the check can be disabled using
          this option.

      --no-md5-cipher

          Do not use *-MD5 ciphers for other protocols than SSLv2.
          This option is only effective with  +cipher  command.

          The purpose is to avoid warnings from  IO::Socket::SSL(1)  like:
              Use of uninitialized value in subroutine entry at lib/IO/Socket/SSL.pm line 430.

          which occours with some versions of IO::Socket::SSL(1) when a *-MD5
          ciphers will be used with other protocols than SSLv2.

          Note that these ciphers will be checked for SSLv2 only.

#
#         IO::Socket::SSL->new() does not return a proper error
#         see in IO::Socket::SSL.pm  Net::SSLeay::CTX_set_cipher_list()  call
#
#     --local
#
#         It does not make much sense trying a connection with a cipher which
#         is  not supported  by the local SSL implementation. Hence these are
#         silently ignored by default.
#         With this option we try to use such ciphers also.
#
#         Option reserved for future use ...

      --nullsslv2

          This option  forces  to assume that  SSLv2  is enabled  even if the
          target does not accept any ciphers.

          The target server may accept connections with  SSLv2  but not allow
          any cipher. Some checks verify if  SSLv2  is enabled at all,  which
          then would result in a failed test.
          The default behaviour is to assume that  SSLv2 is not enabled if no
          ciphers are accepted.

      --http

          Make a HTTP request if cipher is supported.

          If used twice debugging will be enabled using  environment variable
          'HTTPS_DEBUG'.

      --no-http

          Do not make HTTP request.

      --sni

          Make SSL connection in SNI mode.

      --no-sni

          Do not make SSL connection in SNI mode (default: SNI mode).

      --sni-toggle
      --toggle-sni

          Test with and witout SNI mode.

      --force-sni

          Do not check if SNI seems to be supported by  Net::SSLeay(1).
          Older versions of openssl and its libries do not support SNI or the
          SNI support is implemented buggy. By default it's checked if SNI is
          properly supported. With this option this check can be disabled.

          Be warned that this may result in improper results.

      --servername=NAME
      --sni-name=NAME

          Use NAME instead of given hostname to connect to target in SNI mode
          By  default, NAME is automatically set to the given FQDN.
          This is insufficient, when an IP instead of a FQDN was given,  then
          the connection needs to specify the correct hostname (i.g. a FQDN).

          For historical reason, the value '1' is the same as if the the real
          FQDN (given hostname) has been used.  If the value is empty, or the
          value '0' is given, no SNI name will be used.

          Note: i.g. there is no need to use this option,  as a correct value
          for the SNI name will be choosen automatically (except for IPs).
          However, it's kind of fuzzing ...

      --no-cert

          Do not get data from target's certificate, return empty string.

      --no-cert --no-cert

          Do not get data from  target's certificate,  return  default string
          of Net::SSLinfo (see  --no-cert-text=TEXT  option).

      --no-cert-text=TEXT

          Set 'TEXT' to be returned from  Net::SSLinfo if no certificate data
          is collected due to use of  --no-cert.

      --ca-depth=INT

          Check certificate chain to depth 'INT' (like openssl's -verify).

      --ca-file=FILE

          Use 'FILE' with bundle of CAs to verify target's certificate chain.

      --ca-path=DIR

          Use 'DIR' where to find CA certificates in PEM format.

      --ca-force
      --force-ca

        NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
          I. g. openssl uses default settings where to find certificate files.
          When  --ca-file=FILE  and/or  --ca-path=DIR  was used,  this default
          will be overwritten by appropriate options passed to openssl. If the
          default does not work as expected,  --force-ca  can be used to force
          setting of proper values according well known common defaults. See:
              $0 +version
              $0 +version --force-ca

          to see the used settings.

      --alpn

          Use  -alpn  option for openssl.

      --no-alpn

          Do not use  -alpn  option for openssl.

      --no-npn
      --no-nextprotoneg

          Do not use  -nextprotoneg  option for openssl.

      --no-reconnect

          Do not use  -reconnect  option for openssl.

      --no-tlsextdebug

          Do not use  -tlsextdebug  option for openssl.

      --sclient-opt=VALUE

          Argument or option passed to openssl's  s_client  command.

    Options for  +cipher  command

      --connect-delay=SEC

          Additional delay in seconds  after each connect for a cipher check.
          This is useful when connecting to servers which have IPS in place,
          or are slow in accepting new connections or requests.

      --proto-alpn=NAME

          Name of protocol to be added to list of  applcation layer protocols
          (ALPN), which is used for any connection to the targets.
          See  --cipher-alpn=NAME  also.

      --proto-npn=NAME

          Name of protocol to be added to list of  next protocol negotiations
          (NPN), which is used for any connection to the targets.
          See  --cipher-npn=NAME  also.

      --cipher-alpn=NAME

          Name of protocol to be added to list of  applcation layer protocols
          (ALPN), which is used for cipher checks.

          --cipher-alpn=,   sets empty list.
          --cipher-alpn=,,  sets list to empty element "".

      --cipher-npn=NAME

          Name of protocol to be added to list of  next protocol negotiations
          (NPN), which is used for cipher checks.

          --cipher-npn=,   sets empty list.
          --cipher-npn=,,  sets list to empty element "".

          Note:  setting empty list or element most likely does not work with
          openssl executable (i.e.  --force-openssl).

      --cipher-curve=NAME

          Name of ecliptic curve to be added to list of ecliptic curves (EC),
          which is used for cipher checks.

          --cipher-curve=,   sets empty list.
          --cipher-curve=,,  sets list to empty element "".

          Note:  setting empty list or element most likely does not work with
          openssl executable (i.e.  --force-openssl).

    Options for  +cipherall and +cipherraw  command

      --range=RANGE
      --cipherrange=RANGE

          Specify range of cipher constants to be tested by  +cipherall.
          Following RANGEs are supported (see also:  --cipherrange=RANGE):
          * 'rfc'               all ciphers defined in various RFCs
          * 'shifted'           'rfc', shifted by 64 bytes to the right
          * 'long'              like 'rfc' but more lazy list of constants
          * 'huge'              all constants  0x03000000 .. 0x0300FFFF
          * 'safe'              all constants  0x03000000 .. 0x032FFFFF
          * 'full'              all constants  0x03000000 .. 0x03FFFFFF
          * 'SSLv2'             all ciphers according RFC for SSLv2
          * 'SSLv2_long'        more lazy list of constants for SSLv2 ciphers

          Note: 'SSLv2' is the internal list used for testing SSLv2 ciphers.
          It does not make sense to use it for other protocols; however ...

      --slow-server-delay=SEC

          Additional delay in seconds  after the server is connected  using a
          proxy or before starting STARTTLS.
          This is useful when connecting via  slow proxy chains or connecting
          to slow servers before sending the STARTTLS sequence.

      --ssl-maxciphers=CNT

          Maximal number of ciphers sent in a sslhello (default: 32).

      --ssl-double-reneg

          Send SSL extension  'reneg_info'  even if list of ciphers includes
          TLS_EMPTY_RENEGOTIATION_INFO_SCSV (default: do not include)

# alias: --sslnodataeqnocipher --nodataeqnocipher
      --ssl-nodata-nocipher

          Some servers do not answer  (i.g. they disconnect) if  none of  the
          offered ciphers is supported by the server.

          Continue testing with next ciphers  when the target  disconnects or
          does not send data within specified timeout (see --timeout).
          Useful for TLS intolerant servers.

      --no-ssl-nodata-nocipher

          Abort testing with next ciphers when the target disconnects.

      --ssl-use-ecc

          Use supported elliptic curves.  Default on.

      --ssl-use-ec-point

          Use TLS 'ec_point_formats' extension.  Default on.

      --ssl-use-reneg

          Test for ciphers with "secure renegotiation" flag set.
          Default: don't set "secure renegotiation" flag.

      --ssl-retry=CNT

          Number of retries when connection timed-out (default: 2).

      --ssl-timeout=SEC

          Number of seconds to wait until connection is qualified as timeout.

      --dns-mx
      --mx

          Get DNS MX records for given target and check the returned targets.
          (only useful with  --starttls=SMTP).

    Options for checks and results

        Options used for  +check  command:

      --enabled

          Only print result for ciphers accepted by target.

      --disabled

          Only print result for ciphers not accepted by target.

      --ignorecase

          Checks are done case insensitive.

      --no-ignorecase

          Checks are done case sensitive. Default: case insensitive.
          Currently only checks according CN, alternate names in the target's
          certificate compared to the given hostname are effected.

      --ignore-no-reply

          When checking for the  TLS heartbeat extension,  the server may not
          respond at all, which would result in a  "no reply"  message.  This
          marks the check for  +heartbleed  as 'no'.
          I.g.  a server is  not vulnerable to the  heartbleed attack  if the
          TLS heartbeat extension is disabled.  Hence the  check result  'no'
          may be mis-leading.  This option  treats the  "no reply"  result as
          "not vulnerable" and returns  'yes'  then.

          Note: if the server does not respond for this check,  does not mean
          that the heartbeat extension is switched off. So if unsure, disable
          this lazy check with  --no-ignore-no-reply .

    Options for output format

      --short

          Use short, less descriptive, text labels for  +check  and  +info
          command.

      --legacy=TOOL

          For compatibility with other tools,  the output format used for the
          result of the  +cipher  command can be adjusted to mimic the format
          of other SSL testing tools.

          The argument to the  --legacy=TOOL  option  is the name of the tool
          to be simulated.

          Following TOOLs are supported:
          * 'sslaudit'          format of output similar to  sslaudit
          * 'sslcipher'         format of output similar to  ssl-cipher-check
          * 'ssldiagnos'        format of output similar to  ssldiagnos
          * 'sslscan'           format of output similar to  sslscan
          * 'ssltest'           format of output similar to  ssltest
          * 'ssltestg'          format of output similar to  ssltest -g
          * 'ssltest-g'         format of output similar to  ssltest -g
          * 'sslyze'            format of output similar to  sslyze
          * 'ssl-cipher-check'  same as sslcipher
          * 'ssl-cert-check'    format of output similar to  ssl-cert-check
          * 'testsslserver'     format of output similar to  TestSSLServer.jar
          * 'thcsslcHeck'       format of output similar to  THCSSLCheck

          Note that these legacy formats only apply to  output of the checked
          ciphers. Other texts like headers and footers are adapted slightly.

          Please do not expect identical output as the TOOL  when using these
          options, it's a best guess and should be parsable in a very similar
          way.

      --legacy=compact

          Internal format: mainly avoid tabs and spaces format is as follows:
                Some Label:<-- anything right of colon is data

      --legacy=full

          Internal format: pretty print each label in its own line,  followed
          by data prepended by tab character (useful for  +info  only).

      --legacy=quick

          Internal format: use tab as separator; ciphers are printed with bit
          length (implies --tab).

      --legacy=simple

          Internal default format.

      --legacy=key

          Internal format: print name of key instead of text as label. Key is
          that of the internal data structure(s).  For ciphers and protocols,
          the corresponding hex value is used as key.  Note that these values
          are unique.

      --format=0x
      --format=\x
      --format=/x
      --format=hex
      --format=raw

          This option is used to specify the format of the result lines. This
          covers the value of the result line only.

          * 'raw'       Print raw data as passed from  Net::SSLinfo.
            Note:  all data will be printed as is,  without  additional label
            or formatting. It's recommended to use the  option in conjunction
            with exactly one command.  Otherwise the user needs  to know  how
            to "read"  the printed data.

          * 'hex'       Convert some data to hex: 2 bytes separated by ':'.
          * '0x'        Convert some data with hex values:
                           2 bytes preceded by '0x' and separated by a space.
          * '/x'        Same as  --format=\x
          * '\x'        Convert some data with hex values:
                           2 bytes preceded by '\x' and no separating char.

      --header

          Print formatting header.  Default for  +check,  +info,  +quick  and
          and  +cipher  only.

      --no-header

          Do not print formatting header.
          Usefull if raw output should be passed to other programs.

          Note: must be used on command line to inhibit all header lines.

      --ignore-cmd=CMD
      --ignore-output=CMD
      --no-cmd=CMD
      --no-output=CMD

          Do not print output (data or check result) for command 'CMD'. 'CMD'
          is any valid command, see  COMMANDS ,  without leading '+'.
          Option can be used multiple times.

      --score

          Print scoring results. Default for  +check.

      --no-score

          Do not print scoring results.

      --separator=CHAR
      --sep=CHAR

          'CHAR'    will be used as separator between  label and value of the
                    printed results. Default is  ':'.

      --tab

          'TAB' character (0x09, \t)  will be used as separator between label
          and value of the printed results.
          As label and value are already separated by a  TAB  character, this
          options is only useful in conjunction with the  --legacy=compact
          option.

      --showhost

          Prefix each printed line with the given hostname (target).
          The hostname will be followed by the separator character.

#         However, it applies partially if used twice for  +info.

      --std-format=utf8
      --std-format=crnl
      --std-format=raw
      --std-format=unix
      --std-format=CHARSET

          This option is used to specify the general output format for STDOUT
          and STDERR. All results are written to STDOUT,  errors and warnings
          may also be written to STDERR .  The default is ':unix:utf8', which
          is the perlish definition used internally.

          Following values are supported:

          * 'raw'
          * 'unix'      Print raw data, binary in bytes without conversion.
            Note:  binary here just means characters (as all output is text).

          * 'utf8'      Convert all characters to UTF-8.
          * 'crnl'      Use CR LF as end of line.
                        
          * 'CHARSET'   'CHARSET' can be any of the local installed character
                        sets, like UTF-8, UTF-16LE, CP1252, iso-8859-7, etc..
                        This conversion may print its own warnings.

          The option can be used multiple times with different values.
          To reset the  default behaviour, either  'raw'  or  'unix'  must be
          used. Obviously, they must be used first. All other values are used
          additionally.
          Note:  'utf8' just defines the format of the characters, it does no
          further checks on the converted characters. In contrast, 'UTF-8' is
          used as real encoding and does some checks.

          Currently (Jan. 2018), these options must be used before any --help
          option.

      --win-CR

          Obsolete, please use  --std-format=crnl .

    Options for compatibility with other programs

        Please see other programs for detailed description (if not obvious:).
        Note that often only the long form options are accepted as most short
        form options are ambiguous.
        If other programs use the same option,but with a different behaviour,
        then thes other options are not supported.
        For a list of supported options, please see:

    Options for customization

          For general descriptions please see  CUSTOMIZATION  section below.

      --cfg_cmd=CMD=LIST
      --cfg-cmd=CMD=LIST

          Redefine list of commands. Sets  %cfg{cmd-CMD}  to  LIST.  Commands
          can be written without the leading  '+'.
          If  CMD  is any of the known internal commands, it will be redifned.
          If  CMD  is a unknown command, it will be created.

          Example:  --cfg-cmd=sni="sni hostname"
          An example  +preload  can be found in  '.o-saft.pl' .

          To get a list of commands and their settings, use:
              $0 --help=intern

          Main purpose is to reduce list of commands or to print them sorted.

      --cfg-score=KEY=SCORE

          Redefine value for scoring. Sets  %checks{KEY}{score}  to  SCORE.
          Most score values are set to 10 by default. Values '0' .. '100' are
          allowed.

          To get a list of current score settings, use:
              $0 --help=score

          For deatils how scoring works, please see  SCORING  section.

          Use the  --trace-key  option for the  +info  and/or  +check command
          to get the values for  KEY.

      --cfg_checks=KEY=TEXT
      --cfg-checks=KEY=TEXT
      --cfg_data=KEY=TEXT
      --cfg-data=KEY=TEXT

          Redefine texts used for labels in output. Sets  %data{KEY}{txt}  or
          %checks{KEY}{txt}  to  TEXT.

          To get a list of preconfigured labels, use:
              $0 --help=cfg-checks
              $0 --help=cfg-data

      --cfg-cipher=CIPHER=value

          Redefine the security value (i.e. HIGH) in the cipher description.
          Example:
          --cfg-cipher=NULL-MD5=no-security-at-all

      --cfg_text=KEY=TEXT
      --cfg-text=KEY=TEXT

          Redefine general texts used in output. Sets  %text{KEY}  to  TEXT.

          To get a list of preconfigured texts, use:
              $0 --help=cfg-text

          Note that \n, \r and \t are replaced by the corresponding character
          when read from RC-FILE.

      --cfg-hint=KEY=TEXT

          Redefine texts used for hints. Sets  %cfg{hints}{KEY}  to  TEXT.

          To get a list of preconfigured texts, use:
              $0 --help=cfg-hint

      --call=METHOD

          See  X&Options for SSL tool&.

      --usr

          Execute functions defined in  o-saft-usr.pm.

      --usr-*
      --user-*

          Options ignored, but stored as is internal in  $cfg{usr-args} .
          These options can be used in  o-saft-usr.pm  or  o-saft-dbx.pm.

      --experimental

          Use experimental functionality.
          Some functionality of this tool is  under development and only used
          when this option is given.

    Options for tracing and debugging

      --n

          Do not execute, just show commands (only useful in conjunction with
          using openssl).

      Difference --trace vs. --v

          While  --v  is used to print more data,  --trace  is used to  print
          more information about internal data such as procedure names and/or
          variable names and program flow.

      --v

      --verbose

          Print more information about checks.

          Note that this option should be first otherwise some debug messages
          are missing.

          Note that  --v  is different from  -v  (see above).

      --v --v

          Print remotely checked ciphers.

      --v-cipher --cipher-v

          Print remotely checked ciphers.
          In contrast to  --v --v  above,  this just prints the ciphers while
          while being checked, but no other verbose messages.

# following no longer implemented (8/2016)
#
#      --v --v --v
#
#          Print remotely checked ciphers one per line.
#
#      --v --v --v --v
#
#          Print processed ciphers (check, skip, etc.).
#
      --trace

          Print debugging messages.

      --trace --trace

          Print more debugging messages and pass 'trace=2' to Net::SSLeay and
          Net::SSLinfo.

      --trace --trace --trace

          Print more debugging messages and pass 'trace=3' to Net::SSLeay and
          Net::SSLinfo.

      --trace --trace --trace --trace

          Print processing of all command line arguments.

      --trace-arg
      --trace--

          Print command line argument processing.

# cannot use --trace=  'cause = will be removed (CGI mode)

      --trace-cmd

          Trace execution of command processing (those given as  +*).

      --trace-key
      --trace@

          Print some internal variable names in output texts (labels).
          Variable names are prefixed to printed line and enclosed in  # .
          Example without --trace-key :
              Certificate Serial Number:          deadbeef

          Example with    --trace-key :
              #serial#          Certificate Serial Number:          deadbeef

      --trace=VALUE

            Trace Option        Alias Option
          #--------------------+----------------------------#
          * --trace=1           same as  --trace
          * --trace=2           same as  --trace --trace
          * --trace=arg         same as  --trace-arg
          * --trace=cmd         same as  --trace-cmd
          * --trace=key         same as  --trace-key

      --trace-time

          Prints trace output with timestamps. More timestamps are printed if
          used together with  --trace-cmd.

      --trace=FILE

          Use FILE instead of the default rc-file (.o-saft.pl, see RC-FILE).

      --trace-me

          Print debugging messages for $0 only, but not any modules.

      --trace-not-me

          Print debugging messages for modules only, but not $0 istself.

      --trace-sub
      +traceSUB

          Print formatted list of internal functions with their description.
          Not to be intended in conjunction with any target check.

      --hint

          Print hint messages (!!Hint:).

      --no-hint

          Do not print hint messages (!!Hint:).

      --warning

          Print warning messages (**WARNING:).

      --no-warning

          Do not print warning messages (**WARNING:).

      --exit=KEY

          For debugging only: terminate $0 at specified 'KEY'.
          For 'KEY' please see:  'grep exit= $0'

    Options vs. Commands

        For compatibility with other programs and lazy users,  some arguments
        looking like options are silently taken as commands.  This means that
        --THIS  becomes  +THIS  then. These options are:
          * --help
          * --abbr
          * --todo
          * --chain
          * --default
          * --fingerprint
          * --list
          * --version

        Take care that this behaviour may be removed in future versions as it
        conflicts with those options and commands which actually exist, like:

        --sni  vs.  +sni


LAZY SYNOPSIS

    Commands

        Following strings are treated as a command instead of target names:
          * ciphers
          * s_client
          * version

        A warning will be printed.

    Options

        We support following options, which are all identical, for lazy users
        and for compatibility with other programs.

      Option Variants

          * --port PORT
          * --port=PORT

        This applies to most such options,  --port  is just an example.  When
        used in the  RC-FILE, the  --OPTION=VALUE  variant must be used.
# does not apply to --trace option

      Option Names

        Dash '-', dot '.' and/or underscore '_' in option names are optional,
        all following are the same:
          * --no.dns
          * --no-dns
          * --no_dns
          * --nodns

        This applies to all such options,  --no-dns  is just an example.

    Targets

        Following syntax is supported also:
          $0 http://some.tld other.tld:3889/some/path?a=b

        Note that only the hostname and the port are used from an URL.

    Options vs. Commands

        See  X&Options vs. Commands&  in  OPTIONS  section above

CHECKS

        All SSL related check performed by the tool will be described here.

    General Checks

        Lookup the IP of the given hostname (FQDN), and then tries to reverse
        resolve the FQDN again.

    SSL Ciphers

        Check which ciphers are supported by target. Please see  RESULTS  for
        details of this check.

    SSL Connection

      heartbeat

        Check if heartbeat extension is supported by target.

      poodle

        Check if target is vulnerable to POODLE attack (SSLv3 enabled).

      robot

        Check if target is vulnerable to ROBOT attack (server offers ciphers
        with RSA encryption).

      sloth

        Check if target is vulnerable to SLOTH attack  (server offers RSA-MD5
        or ECDSA-MD5 ciphers).

      sweet32

        Check if target is vulnerable to Sweet32 attack (server offers CBC or
        CBC3 or DES or 3DES ciphers).

        Note that FIPS-140 compliance requires 3DES ciphers, hence compliant
        systems are then vulnerable to Sweet32 attacks.

      ALPN

        Check if target supports ALPN. Following messages are evaluated:
              ALPN protocol: h2-14
              No ALPN negotiated
        Please see also  CHECKS  ALPN and NPN  below.

    SSL Vulnerabilities

      ADH

        Check if ciphers for anonymous key exchange are supported: ADH|DHA.
        Such key exchanges can be sniffed.

      EDH

        Check if ephemeral ciphers are supported: DHE|EDH.
        They are necessary to support Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).

      BEAST

        Check if ciphers with CBC for protocol SSLv1, SSLv3 or TLSv1 are used.
        TLSv1.2 checks are not yet implemented.

      CRIME

        Connection is vulnerable if target supports SSL-level compression, or
        supports SPDY/3 (because SPDY/3 uses compression).
        See http://zoompf.com/2012/09/explaining-the-crime-weakness-in-spdy-and-ssl

        Note: SPDY/3 is only possible if the client explicitely asks for this
        alternate protocol (for example  "openssl ... -nextprotoneg spdy/3").

      DROWN

        Connection is vulnerable if target supports SSLv2.

      FREAK

        Attack against SSL/TLS to downgrade to EXPORT ciphers.
        Currently (2015) a simple check is used:   SSLv3 enabled and EXPORT
        ciphers supported by server.
        See CVE-2015-0204 and https://freakattack.com/ .

      HEARTBLEED

        Check if target is vulnerable to heartbleed attack, see CVE-2014-0160
        and http://heartbleed.com/ .

      HEIST

        Not implemented.

        There are no checks for the HEIST attack implemented, because this is
        an attack on TCP/IP rather than SSL/TLS on top of TCP/IP.

      KCI

        To perform a MiTM attack with Key Compromise Impersonation, the atta-
        cker needs to engage the victim to install and use a client certificate.
        This is considered a low risk and hence not tested here.

      Logjam

        Check if target is vulenerable to Logjam attack.
        Check if target suports  EXPORT ciphers  and/or  DH Parameter is less
        than 2048 bits. ECDH must be greater to 511 bits.

      Lucky 13

        Check if CBC ciphers are offered.
        NOTE the recommendation to be safe againts  Lucky 13  was to use  RC4
        ciphers. But they are also subjetc to attacks (see below).  Hence the
        check is only for CBC ciphers.

      RC4

        Check if RC4 ciphers are supported.
        They are assumed to be broken.
        Note that  +rc4  reports the vulnerabilitiy to the  RC4 Attack, while
        +cipher-rc4  simply reports if  RC4 ciphers are offered.  However the
        check, and hence the result, is the same.

      PFS

        Check if DHE ciphers are used.  Checks also if the TLS session ticket
        is random or not used at all.
        Currently (2015) only a simple check is used: only DHE ciphers used.
        Which is any cipher with DHE or ECDHE. SSLv2 does not support PFS.
        TLSv1.2 checks are not yet implemented.

      POODLE

        Check if target is vulnerable to  POODLE attack (just check if  SSLv3
        is enabled).

      Practical Invalid Curve Attack

        This attack allows an attacker to read the servers private key if the
        server does not check properly the passed points for a ecliptic curve
        when EDH ciphers are used.

        This check will not send multiple invalid points,  but only checks if
        the server closes the connection or responds with no matching cipher.

      ROBOT

        Bleichebacher's Oracle attack against SSL/TLS ciphers.

        Not implemented.
        https://robotattack.org/

#      SKIP
#
#       Check if target is vulnerable to  SKIP  attack.
#       Message Skipping Attacks on TLS. Attack to force  server or client  to
#       skip messages in handshake protocol",

      SLOTH

        Currently (2016) we check for ciphers with  ECDSA, RSA-MD5.
        Checking the TLS extension 'tls-unique' is not yet implemented.

      Sweet32

        Currently (2016) we check for ciphers with CBC or CBC3 or DES or 3DES.

      Ticketbleed

        NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
        Check if target is vulnerable to ticketbleed, means that it returns
        up to 31 random bytes from memory as Session Ticket, see CVE-2016-9244
        and https://filippo.io/Ticketbleed/ .

    Target (server) Configuration and Support

      BEAST, BREACH, CRIME, DROWN, FREAK, Logjam, Lucky 13, POODLE, RC4,
      ROBOT, SLOTH, Sweet32

        See above.

      Renegotiation

        Check if the server allows client-side initiated renegotiation.
#        This is known as "Secure Renegotiation".

      Version rollback attacks

        NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
        Check if the server allows changing the protocol.

      DH Parameter

        Check if target's DH Parameter is less 512 or 2048 bits.

    Target (server) Certificate

      Certificate Hashes

        Check that fingerprint is not MD5.
        Check that certificate private key signature is SHA2 or better.

      Root CA

        Provided certificate by target should not be a Root CA.

      Self-signed Certificate

        Certificate should not be self-signed.

      FQDN is listed in subjectAltname (RFC2818)

        The FQDN must be listed in the certificates subjectAltname.
        The check command  +rfc_2818_names  is based on the info command
        +verify_hostname . The check was added in 05/2017 because browsers
        started to complain if the FQDN is not part of the subjectAltname.

      IP in CommonName or subjectAltname (RFC6125)

        NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

      Basic Constraints

        Certificate extension Basic Constraints should be CA:FALSE.
# otherwise someone can generate an intermediate cert

      OCSP, CRL, CPS

        Certificate should contain URL for OCSP and CRL.

      Private Key encyption

        Certificates signature key supports encryption.

      Private Key encyption well known

        Certificates signature key encryption algorithm is well known.

      Public Key encyption

        Certificates public key supports encryption.

      Public Key encyption well known

        Certificates public key encryption algorithm is well known.

      Public Key Modulus size

        Some (historic) SSL implementations are subject to buffer overflow if
#bad#         the key exceeds 16384 or 32768 bits. The check is against 16384 bits.

      Public Key Modulus Exponent size

        The modulus exponent should be = 65537 as it is a prime number and an
        easy to calculate exponent.
        If the exponent is less than 65537, "Boradcast" attacks are possible.

        However, some (mainly historic) SSL implementations may have problems
        to connect because they are not able to do the crypt mathematics with
        exponenents larger than 65536.
# if > 65536 then all clients usisng MS-SSL-stack will fail to connect

        If ecliptive curves are used, the result for these checks is always
        'no (<<N/A ...)'.

      Sizes and Lengths of Certificate Settings

        Serial Number <= 20 octets (RFC5280, 4.1.2.2.  Serial Number)

        ...

      DV-SSL - Domain Validation Certificate

        The Certificate must provide:
          * Common Name '/CN=' field
          * Common Name '/CN=' in 'subject' or 'subjectAltname' field
          * Domain name in 'commonName' or 'altname' field

      EV-SSL - Extended Validation Certificate

        This check is performed according the requirements defined by the CA/
        Browser Forum  https://www.cabforum.org/contents.html .
        The certificate must provide:
          * DV - Domain Validation Certificate (see above)
          * Organization name '/O=' or 'subject' field

        Optional are: '/street=', '/postalCode='

          * Validation period does not exceed 27 month

        See  LIMITATIONS  also.

    Target (server) HTTP(S) Support

      STS header (see RFC 6797)

        Using STS is no perfect security.  While the very first request using
        http: is always prone to a MiTM attack, MiTM is possible to following
        requests again, if STS is not well implemented on the server.
          * Request with http: should be redirected to https:
          * Redirects should use status code 301 (even others will work)
          * Redirect's Location header must contain schema https:
          * Redirect's Location header must redirect to same FQDN
          * Redirect may use Refresh instead of Location header (not RFC6797)
          * Redirects from HTTP must not contain STS header
          * Answer from redirected page (HTTPS) must contain STS header
          * Answer from redirected page for IP must not contain STS header
          * STS header must contain includeSubDirectoy directive
          * STS header max-age should be less than 1 month
          * STS must not be set in http-equiv attribute of a meta TAG

      STS header preload attribute (+preload)

        To satisfy the requirements on  https://hstspreload.appspot.com/  the
        HSTS header must:
          * have the max-age with at least 18 weeks (10886400 seconds)
          * have the includeSubDomains attribute
          * have the preload attribute
          * redirect to https first, then to sub-domains (if redirected)
          * have an HSTS header in each redirect to https.

        Additionally, the site must have:
          * a valid certificate
          * serve all subdomains over https.

        Except the last requirement,  +preload  will do the checks.
        Note that  +preload  is defined in  '.o-saft.pl'  only.

      Public Key Pins header
        TBD - to be described ...

    Sizes

        Mainly in the certificate various counts, lengths and sizes of values
        are checked and reported. All commands for these checks start with
        '+cnt_'  or  '+len_'.  Up to now, there is no  'yes'  or  'no'  value
        for these checks.

        Following commands will check the value to be in  a specific range to
        become  'yes'  or  'no':
          * +sts_maxage1d       - yes if HSTS maxage < 1 day
          * +sts_maxage1m       - yes if HSTS maxage < 1 month
          * +sts_maxage1y       - yes if HSTS maxage < 1 year
          * +sts_maxage18       - yes if HSTS maxage < 18 weeks (5 months)
          * +sts_maxagexy       - yes if HSTS maxage > 1 year
          * +modulus_exp_1      - Public Key Modulus Exponent <>1
          * +modulus_exp_65537  - Public Key Modulus Exponent =65537
          * +modulus_exp_oldssl - Public Key Modulus Exponent <65537
          * +modulus_size_oldssl - Public Key Modulus <16385 bits

        For some details of these cjecks, please see the description above at
          Public Key Modulus Exponent size

        The recommendations for  DH parameters (RSA and ecliptice curve)  are
        are checked as follows:
          * +dh_512             - DH Parameter >= 512 bits
          * +dh_2048            - DH Parameter >= 2048 bits
          * +ecdh_256           - DH Parameter >= 256 bits (ECDH)
          * +ecdh_512           - DH Parameter >= 512 bits (ECDH)
        Note that only one of the checks  '+dh_*'  and  '+ecdh_*'  can return
        'yes'.

    ALPN and NPN

        The commands for the checks to report  'yes'  or  'no', are  +hasalpn
        and  +hasnpn.

        Both, the Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) and the  Next
        Protocol Negotiation (NPN) will be tested. The commands for that are:
          * +alpns
          * +npns

        Each, ALPN and NPN, is tested separately with all known protocols.
        The test sets only one protocol,  tries to make a connection and then
        checks if the protocol was accepted by the server. The collected list
        of protocols will be printed with the aforementioned commands, or the
        +info  command. Note the difference for the commands  +next_protocols
        and  +alpns, where  +next_protocols  simply reports  what  the server
        itself advertises, while  +alpns  reports what the server supports if
        asked for.

    Compliances

        Note that it is not possible to satisfy all following compliances.
        Best match is: 'PSF' and 'ISM' and 'PCI' and 'lazy BSI TR-02102-2'.
# example: fancyssl.hboeck.de
        In general it is difficult to satisfy all conditions of a compliance,
        and it is also difficult to check  all these conditions.  That is why
        some compliance checks are not completely implemented.
        For details see below please.

        Also note that in the  RC-FILE  the output of results for some checks
        is disabled by default. A  '!!Hint:'  message will be printed, if any
        of these checks are used.

OUTPUT

        All output is designed to make it  easily parsable by postprocessors.
        Following rules are used:
          * Lines for formatting or header lines start with  '='.
          * Lines for verbosity or tracing start with  '#'.
          * Errors and warnings start with  '**'.
          * Empty lines are comments ;-)
          * Label texts end with a separation character; default is  ':'.
          * Label and value for all checks are separated by at least one  TAB
            character.
          * Texts for additional information are enclosed in '<<'  and  '>>'.
          * 'N/A'  is used when no proper informations was found or provided.
            Replace  'N/A'  by whatever you think is adequate:  "No answer",
            "Not available",  "Not applicable",  ...

        Lines not described above, will have the form (by default):
              Label for information or check:  TABresult

        For more details on these lines, please refer to  RESULTS  above.

        When used in  --legacy=full  or --legacy=simple  mode, the output may
        contain formatting lines for better (human) readability.

    Postprocessing Output

        It is recommended to use the   --legacy=quick   option, if the output
        should be postprocessed, as it omits the default separation character
        (':' , see above) and just uses on single tab character (0x09, \t  or
        TAB) to separate the label text from the text of the result. Example:
              Label of the performed checkTABresult

        More examples for postprocessing the output can be found here:
              https://github.com/OWASP/O-Saft/blob/master/contrib

CUSTOMIZATION

        This tools can be customized as follows:

        * Using command line options

            This is a simple way to redefine  specific settings.  Please  see
            CONFIGURATION OPTIONS  below.

        * Using Configuration file

            A configuration file can contain multiple configuration settings.
            Syntax is simply  KEY=VALUE. Please see CONFIGURATION FILE below.

        * Using resource files

            A resource file can contain multiple command line options. Syntax
            is the same as for command line options iteself.  Each  directory
            may contain its own resource file. Please see  RC-FILE  below.

        * Using debugging files

            These files are - nomen est omen - used for debugging purposes.
            However, they can be (mis-)used to redefine all settings too.
            Please see  DEBUG-FILE  below.

        * Using user specified code

            This file contains  user specified  program code.  It can also be
            (mis-)used to redefine all settings. Please see USER-FILE  below.

        Customization is done by redefining values in internal data structure
        which are:  %cfg,  %data,  %checks,  %text,  %scores.

        Unless used in  DEBUG-FILE  or  USER-FILE,  there is  no need to know
        these internal data structures or the names of variables; the options
        will set the  proper values.  The key names being part of the option,
        are printed in output with the  --trace-key  option.

        I.g. texts (values) of keys in  %data are those used in output of the
        "Information" section. Texts of keys in  %checks  are used for output
        in "Performed Checks" section.  And texts of keys in  %text  are used
        for additional information lines or texts (mainly beginning with '=').

     Configuration File vs. RC-FILE vs. DEBUG-FILE

        * CONFIGURATION FILE

            Configuration files must be specified with one of the  --cfg-*
            options. The specified file can be a valid path. Please note that
            only the characters:  a-zA-Z_0-9,.\/()-  are allowed as pathname.
            Syntax in configuration file is:  'KEY=VALUE'  where 'KEY' is any
            key as used in internal data structure.

        * RC-FILE

            Resource files are searched for and used automatically.
            For details see  RC-FILE  below.

        * DEBUG-FILE

            Debug files are searched for and used automatically.
            For details see  DEBUG-FILE  below.

        * USER-FILE

            The user program file is included only  if the  --usr  option was
            used. For details see  USER-FILE  below.


    CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

        Configuration options are used to redefine  texts and labels or score
        settings used in output. The options are:
          * --cfg-cmd=KEY=LIST
          * --cfg-checks=KEY=TEXT
          * --cfg-data=KEY=TEXT
          * --cfg-hint=KEY=TEXT
          * --cfg-text=KEY=TEXT
          * --cfg-cipher=CIPHER=TEXT

        KEY  is the key used in the internal data structure, and  TEXT is the
        value to be set for this key.  Note that unknown keys will be ignored
        silently.

        If KEY=TEXT is an exiting filename, all lines from that file are read
        and set. For details see  CONFIGURATION FILE  below.

        CIPHER  must be a valid cipher suite name as shown with:

            $0 ciphers

        NOTE that such configuration options should be used before any --help
        or  --help=*  option, otherwise the changed setting is not visible.

    CONFIGURATION FILE

        Note that the file can contain KEY=TEXT pairs for any kind of the
        configuration as given by the  --cfg-CFG  option.

        For example  when used with  --cfg-text=file  only values for  %text
        will be set, when used with  --cfg-data=file  only values for  %data
        will be set, and so on. KEY is not used  when KEY=TEXT is an existing
        filename. Though, it's recommended to use a non-existing key, i.e.:
        --cfg-text=my_file=some/path/to/private/file .

    RC-FILE

        The rc-file will be searched for in the working directory only.

        The name of the rc-file is the name of the program file prefixed by a
        '.'  (dot),  for example:  '.o-saft.pl'.

        A  rc-file  can contain any of the commands and options valid for the
        tool itself. The syntax for them is the same as on command line. Each
        command or option must be in a single line. Any empty or comment line
        will be ignored. Comment lines start with  '#'  or  '='.

        Note that options with arguments must be used as  'KEY=VALUE' instead
        of  'KEY VALUE'.

        Configurations options must be written like '--cfg-CFG=KEY=VALUE'.

    SHELL TWEAKS

        Configuring the shell environment where the tool is startet,  must be
        done before the tools starts.  It is  not really  a task for the tool
        itself, but it can simplify your life, somehow.

        There exist customizations for some commonly used shells,  please see
        the files in the ./contrib/ directory.

    COMMANDS

        The option  --cfg-cmd=CMD=LIST  can be used to define own commands.
        When configuring own commands,  CMD  must not be  one of the commands
        listed with  --help=intern  and CMD  must constist only of digits and
        letters.

        Examples in  '.o-saft.pl'  are  +preload  and  +ciphercheck .


CIPHER NAMES

        While the SSL/TLS protocol uses integer numbers to identify  ciphers,
        almost all tools use some kind of  "human readable"  texts for cipher
        names.

        These numbers (which are most likely written  as hex values in source
        code and documentations) are the only true identifier, and we have to
        rely on the tools that they use the proper integers.

        As such integer or hex numbers are difficult to handle by humans,  we
        decided to use human readable texts. Unfortunately no common standard
        exists how to construct the names and map them to the correct number.
        Some, but by far not all, oddities are described in  X&Name Rodeo&.

        The rules for specifying cipher names are:
          1) textual names as defined by IANA (see [IANA])
          2) mapping of names and numbers as defined by IANA (see [IANA])
          3) '-'  and  '_'  are treated the same
          4) abbreviations are allowed, as long as they are unique
          5) beside IANA, openssl's cipher names are preferred
          6) name variants are supported, as long as they are unique
          7) hex numbers can be used

        [IANA]    http://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.txt September 2013

        [openssl] ... openssl 1.0.1

        If in any doubt, use  +list --v  to get an idea about the mapping.
        Use  --help=regex  to see which regex are used to handle all variants
        herein.

        Mind the traps and dragons with cipher names and what number they are
        actually mapped to. In particular when  --lib,  --exe  or  --openssl
        options are in use. Always use these options with  +list command too.

    Name Rodeo

        As said above, the  SSL/TLS protocol uses integer numbers to identify
        ciphers, but almost all tools use some kind of  human readable  texts
        for cipher names.

        For example the cipher commonly known as 'DES-CBC3-SHA' is identified
        by '0x020701c0' (in openssl) and has 'SSL2_DES_192_EDE3_CBC_WITH_SHA'
        as constant name. A definition is missing in IANA, but there is
        'TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA'.  Thers is also '0x000A' for the same
        cipher 'DES-CBC3-SHA'.  Both are valid, first one if used with SSLv2,
        and second one when used with SSLv3.
        It's the responsibility of each tool to map the human readable cipher
        name to the correct (hex, integer) identifier.

        For example Firefox uses  'dhe_dss_des_ede3_sha',  which is what?

        Furthermore, there are different acronyms for the same thing in use.
        For example  'DHE'  and  'EDH'  both mean "Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman".
        Comments in the  openssl(1)  sources mention this.  And for curiosity
        these sources use both in cypher names, but allow  'EDH'  as shortcut
        only in openssl's "ciphers"  command. Wonder about (up to 1.0.1h):
              openssl ciphers -V EDH
              openssl ciphers -V DHE
              openssl ciphers -V EECDH
              openssl ciphers -V ECDHE

        Next example is  'ADH'  which is also known as  'DH_anon' or 'DHAnon'
        or  'DHA'  or  'ANON_DH'.

        You think this is enough? Then have a look how many acronyms are used
        for  "Tripple DES".

        Compared to above, the interchangeable use of  '-'  vs.  '_' in human
        readable cipher names is just a very simple one. However, see openssl
        again what following means (returns):
              openssl ciphers -v RC4-MD5
              openssl ciphers -v RC4+MD5
              openssl ciphers -v RC4:-MD5
              openssl ciphers -v RC4:!MD5
              openssl ciphers -v RC4!MD5

        Looking at all these oddities, it would be nice to have a common unique
        naming scheme for cipher names. We have not.  As the SSL/TLS protocol
        just uses a number, it would be natural to use the number as uniq key
        for all cipher names, at least as key in our internal sources.

        Unfortunately, the assignment of ciphers to numbers  changed over the
        years, which means that the same number refers to a  different cipher
        depending on the standard, and/or tool, or version of a tool you use.

        As a result, we cannot use human readable cipher names as  identifier
        (aka unique key), as there are  to many aliases  for the same cipher.
        And also the number  cannot be used  as unique key, as a key may have
        multiple ciphers assigned.

        The default behaviour will be to use the cipher names like openssl(1)
        does. If a name is ambigous, the first matching will be choosen. This
        -first matching- only applies to names provided by the user by option
        or whatever, internally the latest IANA number will be used,  because
        they have the most less ambiguities.


KNOWN PROBLEMS

        This section describes knwon problems, and known error messages which
        may occour when using $0. This sections can be used as FAQ too
        as it gives hints and workarounds.

    Segmentation fault

        Sometimes  the program terminates with a  'Segmentation fault'.  This
        mainly happens if the target does not return certificate information.
        If so, the  --no-cert  option may help.

    **WARNING: empty result from openssl; ignored at ...

        This most likely occurs when the  provided cipher is  not accepted by
        the server, or the server expects client certificates.

    **WARNING: unknown result from openssl; ignored at ...

        This most likely occurs when the openssl(1) executable is used with a
        very slow connection. Typically the reason is a connection timeout.
        Try to use  --timeout=SEC  option.
        To get more information, use  --v --v  and/or  --trace  also.

    **WARNING: undefined cipher description

        May occour if ciphers are checked, but no description is available for
        them herein. This results in printed cipher checks like:
              EXP-KRB5-RC4-MD5                no       <<undef>>

        instead of:
              EXP-KRB5-RC4-MD5                no       weak

    **WARNING: Can't make a connection to your.tld:443; no initial data
    **WARNING: Can't make a connection to your.tld:443; target ignored

        This message occours if the underlaying  SSL library (i.e. libssl.a)
        was not able to connect to the target. Known observed reasons are:
          * target does not support SSL protocol on specified port
          * target expects a client certificate in ClientHello message

        More details why the connection failed can be seen using  --trace=2 .

        If the targets supports SSL, it should be at least possible to check
        for supported ciphers using  +cipherall  instead of  +cipher .


    Use of uninitialized value $headers in split ... do_httpx2.al)

        The warning message (like follows or similar):

              Use of uninitialized value $headers in split at blib/lib/Net/SSLeay.pm
              (autosplit into blib/lib/auto/Net/SSLeay/do_httpx2.al) line 1290.

        occurs if the target refused a connection on port 80.
        This is considered a bug in  Net::SSLeay(1).
        Workaround to get rid of this message: use  --no-http  option.

    invalid SSL_version specified at ... IO/Socket/SSL.pm

        This error may occur on systems where a specific  SSL version is not
        supported. Subject are mainly  SSLv2, SSLv3 TLSv1.3 and DTLSv1.
        For DTLSv1 the full message looks like:
              invalid SSL_version specified at C:/programs/perl/perl/vendor/lib/IO/Socket/SSL.
        See also  X&Note on SSL versions& .

        Workaround: use option: --no-sslv2 --no-sslv3 --no-tlsv13 --no-dtlsv1

    Use of uninitialized value $_[0] in length at (eval 4) line 1.

        This warning occours with IO::Socket::SSL 1.967, reason is unknown.
        It seems not to harm functionality, hence no workaround, just ignore.

    Use of uninitialized value in subroutine entry at lib/IO/Socket/SSL.pm line 430.

        Some versions of  IO::Socket::SSL return this error message if  *-MD5
        ciphers are used with other protocols than SSLv2.

        Workaround: use  --no-md5-cipher  option.

    Can't locate auto/Net/SSLeay/CTX_v2_new.al in @INC ...

        Underlaying library doesn't support the required SSL version.
        See also  X&Note on SSL versions& .

        Workaround: use  --ssl-lazy option, or corresponding --no-SSL option.

    Read error: Connection reset by peer (,199725) at blib/lib/Net/SSLeay.pm\
    (autosplit into blib/lib/auto/Net/SSLeay/tcp_read_all.al) line 535.

        Error reported by some Net::SSLeay versions. Reason may be a timeout.
        This error cannot be omitted or handled properly.

        Workaround: try to use same call again (no guarantee, unfortunatelly)
# see Net::SSLinfo.pm for details

    Odd number of elements in anonymous hash at Net/SSLinfo.pm line 1613.

        This warning from perl have been observed  when the connection to the
        target to check for supported ciphers cannot be established.

        This message can be ignored.

    openssl: ...some/path.../libssl.so.1.0.0: no version information available (required by openssl)

        Mismatch of  openssl executable  and loaded underlaying library. This
        most likely happens when options  --lib=PATH  and/or  --exe=PATH  are
        used.  See also  X&Note on SSL versions& .

        Hint: use following commands to get information about used libraries:
              $0 +version
              $0 --v --v +version

    Integer overflow in hexadecimal number at ...

        This error message may occour on  32-bit systems if perl was not com-
        piled with proper options. I.g. perl automatically converts the value
        to a floating pont number.
        Please report a bug with output of following command:
          $0 +s_client +dump your.tld

    <<openssl did not return DH Paramter>>

        Text may be part of a value. This means that all checks according  DH
        parameters and logkam attack cannot be done.

        Workaround: try to use  --openssl=TOOL  option.

        This text may appears in any of the compliance checks (like +rfc7525)
        which may be a false positive.  For these checks openssl is also used
        to get the DH Parameter.

        Workaround: not available yet

    No output with  +help  and/or  --help=todo

        On some (mainly Windows-based) systems using
              $0 +help
              $0 --help

        does not print anything.

        Workaround: use  --v  option.
              $0 +help --v

        or
              $0 +help | more

    Character set (like UTF-8) not recognized in some tools

        Some tools do not diplay all characters properly,  i.e. some versions
        of podviewer. It is not the obligation of this tool to fix well known
        bugs in other tools. However, we can offer workarounds.

        Workaround: generate the affected output using --std-format=* options
        For example:
              $0 --no-rc --std-format=raw --help=gen-pod

    **WARNING: on MSWin32 additional option  --v  required, sometimes ...

        On some (mainly Windows-based) systems  this may happen  when calling
        for example:
              $0 --help=FAQ

        which then may produce:
              **WARNING: on MSWin32 additional option  --v  required, sometimes ...
              === reading: ./.o-saft.pl (RC-FILE done) ===
              === reading: Net/SSLinfo.pm (O-Saft module done) ===
              **USAGE: no command given
              # most common usage:
                o-saft.pl +info   your.tld
                o-saft.pl +check  your.tld
                o-saft.pl +cipher your.tld
              # for more help use:
                o-saft.pl --help

        Workaround: use full path to perl.exe, for example
          C:\Programs\perl\bin\perl.exe $0 --help=FAQ


    Performance Problems

        There are various reasons when the program responds slow, or seems to
        hang. Performance issues are most likely a target-side problem.  Most
        common reasons are (no specific order):

          a) DNS resolver problems
             Try with  --no-dns

          b) target does not accept connections for https
             Try with  --no-http

          c) target's certificate is not valid
             Try with  --no-cert

          d) target expects that the client provides a client certificate
             No option provided yet ...

          e) target does not handle Server Name Indication (SNI)
             Try with  --no-sni

          f) use of external openssl(1) executable
             Use  --no-openssl

          g) target does not respond at all and/or blocks
             Use  --ssl-error
             For a detailed description, please see "Connection Problems".

        Other options which may help to get closer to the problem's cause:
        --trace=time,  --timeout=SEC,  --trace,  --trace=cmd

        Using  --trace=time   should show following times:
          * DNS:             1 -  10 sec
          * need_default:    <5 sec
          * need_cipher:     1 - 299 sec (+cipher with socket)
          * need_cipher:     1 -  20 sec (+cipherraw)
          * no SNI:          1 -  10 sec
          * connection test: 1 -   5 sec
          * prepare checks:  2 -  20 sec
          *   checkalpn.     1 -  15 sec
          *   checkprot.     1 -  15 sec
          * cipher:          <1 sec
          * info:            <1 sec
          * check:           <1 sec


LIMITATIONS

    Commands

        Some commands cannot be used together with others, for example:
        +cipher,  +ciphers,  +list,  +libversion,  +version,  +check,  +help,
        +protocols .

        +quick  should not be used together with other commands, it returns
        strange output then. It is the only command which allows  +cipher
        together with other commands.

        +protocols  requires  openssl(1)  with support for  '-nextprotoneg'
        option. Otherwise the value will be empty.

    Options

        The option  --port=PORT  must preceed  --host=HOST  for a target like
        HOST:PORT  .

        The characters  '+' and '='  cannot be used for  --separator  option.

        Following strings should not be used in any value for options:
          '+check', '+info', '+quick', '--header'
        as they my trigger the  --header   option unintentional.

        The used  timeout(1)  command cannot be defined with a full path like
        openssl(1)  can with the  --openssl=path/to/openssl .

        --cfg-text=file  cannot be used to redefine the texts  'yes' and 'no'
        as used in the output for  +cipher  command.

    Checks (general)

      +constraints

          This check is only done for the certificate provided by the target.
          All other certificate in the chain are not checked.

          This is currently (2015) a limitation in $0.

    Broken pipe

        This error message most likely means that the connection to specified
        target was not possible (firewall or whatever reason).

    Target Certificate Chain Verification

        The systems default capabilities i.e. libssl.so, openssl, are used to
        verify the target's certificate chain.  Unfortunately various systems
        have implemented different  approaches and rules how identify and how
        to report a successful verification.  As a consequence  this tool can
        only return the  same information about the chain verification as the
        used underlying tools.  If that information is trustworthy depends on
        how trustworthy the tools are.

        These limitations apply to following commands:
          * +verify
          * +selfsigned

        Following commands and options are useful to get more information:
          * +chain_verify,  +verify,  +error_verify,  +chain,  +s_client
          * --ca-file,  --ca-path,  --ca-depth

    User Provided Files

        Please note that there cannot be any guarantee that the code provided
        in the  DEBUG-FILE  o-saft-dbx.pm  or  USER-FILE  o-saft-usr.pm  will
        work flawless. Obviously this is the user's responsibility.

    Problems and Errors

        Checking the target for supported ciphers may return that a cipher is
        not supported by the server  misleadingly.  Reason is most likely  an
        improper timeout for the connection. See  --timeout=SEC  option.

        If the specified targets accepts connections but does not speak  SSL,
        the connection will be closed after the system's TCP/IP-timeout. This
        script will hang (about 2-3 minutes).

        If reverse DNS lookup fails, an error message is returned as hostname,
        like:  '<<gethostbyaddr() failed>>'.
        Workaround to get rid of this message: use  --no-dns  option.

        All checks for EV are solely based on the information provided by the
        certificate.

        Some versions of openssl (< 1.x) may not support all required options
        which results in various error messages,  or  more worse,  may not be
        visibale at all. Available functionalitity of openssl will be checked
        for right at the beginning. Proper warnings and hints are printed.
        Following table shows the openssl option and how to disable it within
        $0:
          * -nextprotoneg       --no-nextprotoneg
          * -reconnect          --no-reconnect
          * -tlsextdebug        --no-tlsextdebug
          * -alpn               --no-alpn

    Connection Problems

        Sometimes the connection cannot be established. This may have various
        reasons.  Unfortunaly this script seems to hang then.  In  particular
        when checking for ciphers with  +cipher  or  +cipherall  . The reason
        is most likely that the server does not respond to the TCP/IP request
        and hence the script closes the connection after the configured time-
        out (see  --timeout=SEC  option).

        Continous connection attempts  can be inhibited with the  --ssl-error
        option, which is set by default. Avoiding further connections results
        in a loss of information and consequentely, leads to wrong checks.

        It is a trade-off to wait for all information done accurately,  or to
        get the results quickly. The logic to stop connecting for --ssl-error
        can be controlled with following additional options:
          * --ssl-error-max=CNT     - max. continous errors
          * --ssl-error-timeout=SEC - treat a failure as error after timeout
          * --ssl-error-total=CNT   - max. amount of errors

        This means that no more connections are maid when more than
          * --ssl-error-max errors occour sequentialy
        or
          * --ssl-error-total errors occoured

        Examples:
          * --ssl-error-max=3
          * --ssl-error-timeout=6
          * --ssl-error-total=6
        no more connections are made if for example  any sequence of timeouts
        occour:
          0 5 2 2                   - --ssl-error-max matches
          0 1 3 0 0 0 4 1 2 2 2     - --ssl-error-max matches
          0 5 0 2 0 2 2 0 2 0 2     - --ssl-error-total matches

        This allows to fine-tune the condition when to stop connecting to the
        target. For example, continous but not consecutive timeouts may indi-
        cate a bad or instable network connection, but not that the target to
        be connected blocks. In such a case sequence of timeouts like follows
        may be observed (assuming --ssl-error-max=3):
          0 5 1 2 2 2 4 2 3 2 3 3 3 2
                ^                 ^____ stop for --ssl-error-timeout=3
                |______________________ stop for --ssl-error-timeout=2

        On normal (even slow) network connections  dozens of  connections per
        second are usual, hence the timeout is always  0 or 1.  Based on that
        experience  --ssl-error  is enabled and set with defaults as follows:
          * --ssl-error-max=5
          * --ssl-error-timeout=1
          * --ssl-error-total=10

    Poor Systems

        Use of  openssl(1)  is disabled by default on  Windows due to various
        performance problems. It needs to be enabled with  --openssl  option.

        On Windows the usage of  "openssl s_client" needs to be enabled using
        --s_client  option.

        On Windows it's a pain to specify the path for  --openssl=..  option.
        Variants are:
          * --openssl=/path/to/openssl.exe
          * --openssl=X:/path/to/openssl.exe
          * --openssl=\path\to\openssl.exe
          * --openssl=X:\path\to\openssl.exe
          * --openssl=\\path\\to\\openssl.exe
          * --openssl=X:\\path\\to\\openssl.exe

        You have to fiddle around to find the proper one.

    Debug and Trace Output

        When both  --trace=key  and  --trace=cmd  options are used, output is
        mixed, obviously. Hint: output for --trace=cmd always contains "CMD".


DEPENDENCIES

        All perl modules and all  private moduels and files  will be searched
        for using paths  available in the  '@INC'  variable.  '@INC'  will be
        prepended by following paths:

          * .
          * ./lib
          * INSTALL_PATH
          * INSTALL_PATH/lib

        Where  'INSTALL_PATH'  is the path where the tool is installed.
        To see which files have been included use:
              $0 +version --v --user

    Perl Modules

        * IO::Socket::SSL(1)
        * IO::Socket::INET(1)
        * Net::SSLeay(1)
        * Net::SSLinfo
        * Net::SSLhello

    Additional files used if requested

        * .o-saft.pl
        * o-saft-dbx.pm
        * o-saft-man.pm
        * o-saft-usr.pm
        * o-saft-README
        * o-saft-docker


INSTALLATION

        The tool can be installed in any path. It just requres the modules as
        described in  DEPENDENCIES  above. However, it's recommended that the
        modules  Net::SSLhello  and  Net::SSLinfo  are found in the directory
        './Net/'  where  'o-saft.pl'  is installed.

        For security reasons, most modern libraries  disabled or even removed
        insecure or "dirty" functionality.  As the purpose of this tool is to
        detect such insecure settings, functions, etc.,  it needs these dirty
        things enabled. It needs (incomplete list):

          * insecure protocols like SSLv2, SSLv3
          * more ciphers enabled, like NULL-MD5, AECDH-NULL-SHA, etc.
          * some SSL extensions and options

        Therefore we recommend to compile and install at least following:

          * OpenSSL  with SSLv2, SSLv3 and more ciphers enabled
          * Net::SSLeay  compiled with openssl version as described before.

        Please read the  SECURITY  section first before following the install
        instructions below.

    OpenSSL

        Currently it is recommend to use either the openssl version from
         https://github.com/PeterMosmans/openssl/ which requires compilation,
        see  X&Example: Compile OpenSSL&, or use any of the precomiled versions
        which are available for several platforms at https://testssl.sh/ .

        The sources are available at
          * https://github.com/PeterMosmans/openssl/archive/1.0.2-chacha.zip
        The precomiled static versions are available at
          * https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh/tree/master/bin

        For all following installation examples we assume:
          * openssl-1.0.2-chacha.zip or openssl-1.0.2d.tar.gz
          * /usr/local as base installation directory
          * a bourne shell (sh) compatible shell

    Example: Precompiled OpenSSL

        Simply download the tarball or zip file for your platform, unpack it,
        and install (copy) the binaries into a directory of your choice.

    Example: Compile OpenSSL

        OpenSSL can be used from http://openssl.org/ or, as recommended, from
        https://github.com/PeterMosmans/openssl/ .

        OpenSSL-chacha
        Compiling and installing the later is as simple as:

              unzip openssl-1.0.2-chacha.zip
              cd openssl-1.0.2-chacha
              ./config --shared -Wl,-rpath=/usr/local/lib
              make
              make test
              make install

        which will install openssl, libssl.so, libcrypto.so  and some include
        files as well as the include files in  /usr/local/ .
        The shared version of the libraries are necessary for  Net::SSLeay.

        OpenSSL.org
        Building openssl from the offical  openssl.org  sources requires some
        patching before compiling and installing the libraries and binaries.

        Example with openssl-1.0.2d:

              echo == unpack tarball
              tar xf openssl-1.0.2d.tar.gz
              cd openssl-1.0.2d

              echo == backup files to be modified
              cp ssl/s2_lib.c{,.bak}
              cp ssl/s3_lib.c{,.bak}
              cp ssl/ssl3.h{,.bak}
              cp ssl/tls1.h{,.bak}

              echo == patch files
              vi ssl/tls1.h         +/TLS1_ALLOW_EXPERIMENTAL_CIPHERSUITES/
                       # define TLS1_ALLOW_EXPERIMENTAL_CIPHERSUITES  1
              vi ssl/ssl3.h ssl/s{2,3}_lib.c   +"/# *if 0/"
                       #==> remove all   # if 0  and corresponding  #endif
                       #    except if lines contain:
                       #        _FZA
                       #        /* Fortezza ciphersuite from SSL 3.0
                       #        /* Do not set the compare functions,
                       #        if (s->shutdown & SSL_SEND_SHUTDOWN)

              echo == configure with static libraries
              echo omitt the zlib options if zlib-1g-dev is not installed
              echo omitt the krb5 options if no kerberos libraries available
              ./config --prefix=/usr/local --openssldir=/usr/local/ssl \

              make test
              echo next make will overwrite the previously installed dynamic
              echo shared openssl binary with the static openssl binary
              make install

    Example: Compile Net::SSLeay

        To enable support for ancient protocol versions,  Net::SSLeay must be
        compiled manually after patching 'SSLeay.xs' (see below).
        Reason is, that  Net::SSLeay  enables some functionality for  SSL/TLS
        according the identified openssl version. There is, currently (2015),
        no possibility to enable this functionality  by passing options on to
        the configuration script 'perl Makefile.PL'.

        Building our own library and module (with openssl from '/usr/local'):

              echo == unpack tarball
              tar xf Net-SSLeay-1.72.tar.gz
              cd Net-SSLeay-1.72

              echo == patch files
              echo "edit SSLeay.xs and change some #if as described below"
              env OPENSSL_PREFIX=/usr/local perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/usr/local \
                    INC=-I/usr/local/include  DEFINE=-DOPENSSL_BUILD_UNSAFE=1
              make
              make install
              cd /tmp && $0 +version

        SSLeay.xs needs to be changed as follows:
          * search for
              #ifndef OPENSSL_NO_SSL2
              #if OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER < 0x10000000L

              const SSL_METHOD *
              SSLv2_method()

              #endif
              #endif

              #ifndef OPENSSL_NO_SSL3
              #if OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER < 0x10002000L

              const SSL_METHOD *
              SSLv3_method()

              #endif
              #endif

          * and replace by
              const SSL_METHOD *
              SSLv2_method()

              const SSL_METHOD *
              SSLv3_method()

        Note that  Net::SSLeay  will be installed in '/usr/local/' then. This
        can be adapted to your needs by passing another path to the  'PREFIX'
        and  'DESTDIR'  parameter.

        Following command can be used to check  which methods are avilable in
        Net::SSLeay, hence above patches can be verified:

              perl -MNet::SSLinfo -le 'print Net::SSLinfo::ssleay_test();'

    Testing OpenSSL

        After installation as descibed above finished, openssl may be tested:

              echo already installed openssl (found with PATH environment)
              openssl ciphers -v
              openssl ciphers -V -ssl2
              openssl ciphers -V -ssl3
              openssl ciphers -V ALL
              openssl ciphers -V ALL:COMPLEMENTOFALL
              openssl ciphers -V ALL:eNULL:EXP

              echo own compiled and installed openssl
              /usr/local/openssl ciphers -v
              /usr/local/openssl ciphers -V -ssl2
              /usr/local/openssl ciphers -V -ssl3
              /usr/local/openssl ciphers -V ALL
              /usr/local/openssl ciphers -V ALL:COMPLEMENTOFALL
              /usr/local/openssl ciphers -V ALL:eNULL:EXP

        The difference should be obvious.
        Note, the commands using  "ALL:COMPLEMENTOFALL"  and  "ALL:eNULL:EXP"
        should return the same result.

    Testing Net::SSLeay

        As we want to test the separately installed  Net::SSLeay,  it is best
        to do it with  $0  itself:

              $0 +version

        we should see a line similar to follwong at the end of the output:
              Net::SSLeay   1.72  /usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl/5.20.2/Net/SSLeay.pm

        Now check for supported (known) ciphers:

              $0 ciphers -V

        we should see lines similar to those of the last '/usr/local/openssl'
        call. However, it should contain more cipher lines.

    Stand-alone Executable

        Some people asked for a stand-alone executable (mainly for Windows).
        Even perl is a scripting language there are situations where a stand-
        alone executable would be nice, for example if the installed perl and
        its libraries are outdated, or if perl is missing at all.

        Currently (2016) there are following possibilities to generate such a
        stand-alone executable:

          * perl with PAR::Packer module
              pp -C -c $0
              pp -C -c $0 -M Net::DNS -M Net::SSLeay -M IO::Socket \
                          -M Net::SSLinfo -M Net::SSLhello -M osaft
              pp -C -c checkAllCiphers.pl
              pp -C -c checkAllCiphers.pl -M Net::DNS

          * ActiveState perl with its perlapp
              perlapp --clean $0
              perlapp --clean $0 -M Net::DNS -M Net::SSLeay -M IO::Socket \
                          -M Net::SSLinfo -M Net::SSLhello -M osaft
              perlapp --clean checkAllCiphers.pl
              perlapp --clean checkAllCiphers.pl -M Net::DNS -M osaft

          * perl2exe from IndigoSTar
              perl2exe $0
              perl2exe checkAllCiphers.pl

        For details  on building the executable,  for example  how to include
        all required modules, please refer to the documentation of the tool.
           * http://search.cpan.org/~rschupp/PAR-Packer-1.030/lib/PAR/Packer.pm
           * http://docs.activestate.com/pdk/6.0/PerlApp.html
           * http://www.indigostar.com

        Note that  pre-build executables (build by perlapp, perl2exe)  cannot
        be provided due to licence problems.
        Also note that using  stand-alone executable have not been tested the
        same way as the $0 itself. Use them at your own risk.


DOCKER

        The tool can be used inside a Docker image. To start  $0  inside
        the Docker image, use following:

              o-saft-docker +info some.tld
        or
              docker run --rm -it owasp/o-saft +info some.tld

        For more details, please refer to:

              o-saft-docker usage
              o-saft-docker -help


BUILD DOCKER IMAGE

        The Docker image can be installed as follows:

              docker pull owasp/o-saft

        The image can also easily be build from the Dockerfile (which is part
        of the distribution) as follows:

              o-saft-docker build

        To build the image from the Dockerfile with docker commands, see:

              o-saft-docker -n build

        For more details, please refer to:

              o-saft-docker -help

HACKER's INFO

    Note on SSL versions

        Automatically detecting the supported SSL versions of the underlaying
        system is a hard job and not always possible. Reasons could be:

        * used perl modules (Socket::SSL, Net::SSLeay) does not handle errors
          properly. Erros may be:
              invalid SSL_version specified at ... IO/Socket/SSL.pm
              Use of uninitialized value in subroutine entry at lib/IO/Socket/SSL.pm

          There're some workarounds implemented since version 15.11.15 .

        * the underlaying libssl does not support the version, which then may
          result in segmentation fault

        * the underlaying libssl is newer than the perl module and the module
          has not been reinstalled. This most often happens with  Net::SSLeay
          This can be detected with (see version numbers for Net::SSLeay):
              $0 +version

        * perl (in particular a used module, see above)  may bail out  with a
          compile error, like
              Can't locate auto/Net/SSLeay/CTX_v2_new.al in @INC ...

          There're some workarounds implemented since version 15.11.15 .

        We try to detect unsupported versions and disable them automatically,
        a warning like follwoing is shown then:
              **WARNING: SSL version 'SSLv2': not supported by openssl

        All such warnings look like:
              **WARNING: SSL version 'SSLv2': ...

        If problems occour with  SSL versions, following commands and options
        may help to get closer to the reason or can be used as workaround:
              $0 +version
              $0 +version --v
              $0 +version | grep versions
              $0 +version | grep 0x
              $0 +protocols your.tld
              $0 +protocols your.tld --no-rc

        Checking for SSL version is done at one place in the code, search for
              supported SSL versions

        However, there are some dirty hacks where  SSLv2 and SSLv3 is checked
        again.

    Using private libssl.so and libcrypt.so

        For all  cryptographic functionality  the libraries  installed on the
        system will be used. In particular perl's Net::SSLeay(1)  module, the
        system's  libssl.so and libcrypt.so  and the  openssl(1)  executable.

        It is possible to provide your own libraries, if the  perl module and
        the executable are  linked using  dynamic shared objects  (aka shared
        library, position independent code).
        The appropriate option is  --lib=PATH.

        On most systems these libraries are loaded at startup of the program.
        The runtime loader uses a preconfigured list of directories  where to
        find these libraries. Also most systems provide a special environment
        variable to specify  additional paths  to directories where to search
        for libraries, for example the  LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
        This is the default environment variable used herein.  If your system
        uses  another name it must be specified with the  --envlibvar=NAME
        option, where  NAME  is the name of the environment variable.

    Understanding  --exe=PATH, --lib=PATH, --openssl=FILE

        If any of  --exe=PATH  or  --lib=PATH  is provided, the pragram calls
        ('exec') itself recursively with all given options, except the option
        itself. The environment variables  'LD_LIBRARY_PATH'  and 'PATH'  are
        set before executing as follows:
          * prepend  'PATH'  with all values given with  --exe=PATH
          * prepend  'LD_LIBRARY_PATH'  with all values given with --lib=PATH


        This is exactly, what X&Cumbersome Approach& below describes. So these
        option simply provide a shortcut for that.

        Note that  --openssl=FILE  is a full path to the  openssl  executable
        and will not be changed.  However, if it is a relative path, it might
        be searched for using the previously set  'PATH'  (see above).

        Note that  'LD_LIBRARY_PATH'  is the default.  It can be changed with
        the  --envlibvar=NAME  option.

        While  --exe  mainly impacts the  openssl(1) executable,  --lib  also
        impacts o-saft.pl itself, as it loads other shared libraries if found.

        Bear in mind that  all these options  can affect the behaviour of the
        openssl subsystem,  influencing both  which executable is called  and
        which shared libraries will be used.

        NOTE that no checks are done if the options are set proper. To verify
        the settings, following commands may be used:
          $0 --lib=YOU-PATH --exe=YOUE-EXE +version
          $0 --lib=YOU-PATH --exe=YOUE-EXE --v +version
          $0 --lib=YOU-PATH --exe=YOUE-EXE --v --v +version

        Why so many options?  Exactly as described above, these options allow
        the users to tune the behaviour of the tool to their needs.  A common
        use case is to enable the use of a separate openssl build independent
        of the openssl package used by the operating system.  This allows the
        user fine grained control over openssl's encryption suites  which are
        compiled/available, without affecting the core system.

    Caveats

        Depending on your system and the used modules and executables, it can
        be tricky to replace the configured shared libraries with own ones.
        Reasons are:
          a) the linked library name contains a version number,
          b) the linked library uses a fixed path,
          c) the linked library is searched at a predefined path,
          d) the executable checks the library version when loaded.

        Only the first one a) can be circumvented.  The last one d) can often
        be ignored as it only prints a warning or error message.

        To circumvent the "name with version number" problem try following:

        1) use  ldd(1)  (or a similar tool) to get the names used by openssl:

              ldd /usr/bin/openssl

        which returns something like:

              libssl.so.0.9.8 => /lib/libssl.so.0.9.8 (0x00007f940cb6d000)
              libcrypto.so.0.9.8 => /lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.8 (0x00007f940c7de000)
              libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f940c5d9000)
              libz.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so.1 (0x00007f940c3c1000)
              libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f940c02c000)
              /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f940cdea000)

        Here only the first two libraries are important.  Both,  libcrypto.so
        and libssl.so  need to be version "0.9.8" (in this example).

        2) create a directory for your libraries, i.e.:

              mkdir /tmp/dada

        3) place your libraries there, assuming they are:

              /tmp/dada/libssl.so.1.42
              /tmp/dada/libcrypto.so.1.42

        4) create symbolic links in that directory:

              ln -s libssl.so.1.42    libssl.so.0.9.8
              ln -s libcrypto.so.1.42 libcrypto.so.0.9.8

        5) test program with following option:

              $0 +libversion --lib=/tmp/dada
              $0 +list --v   --lib=/tmp/dada

          or:

              $0 +libversion --lib=/tmp/dada -exe=/path/to-openssl
              $0 +list --v   --lib=/tmp/dada -exe=/path/to-openssl

        6) start program with your options, i.e.:

              $0 --lib=/tmp/dada +ciphers

        This works if  openssl(1)  uses the same shared libraries as
        Net::SSLeay(1),  which most likely is the case.

        It's tested with Unix/Linux only. It may work on other platforms also
        if they support such an environment variable and the installed
        Net::SSLeay(1)  and  openssl(1)  are linked using dynamic shared
        objects.

        Depending on  compile time settings  and/or  the location of the used
        tool or lib, a warning like following may occur:

              WARNING: can't open config file: /path/to/openssl/ssl/openssl.cnf

        This warning can be ignored, usually as  req  or  ca  sub commands of
        openssl is not used here.
        To fix the problem, either use  --openssl-cnf=FILE  option or set the
        the environment variable OPENSSL_CONF properly.

      Cumbersome Approach

        A more cumbersome approach to call  this program is to set  following
        environment variables in your shell:

              PATH=/tmp/dada-1.42/apps:$PATH
              LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/dada-1.42

      Windows Caveats

        I.g. the used libraries on Windows are libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll.

        Windows also supports the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. If it
        does not work as expected with that variable, it might be possible to
        place the libs in the same directory as the  corresponding executable
        (which is found by the PATH environment variable).
# openssl.exe 1.0.0e needs: libeay32.dll, ssleay32.dll

    Using CGI mode

        This script can be used as  CGI application. Output is the same as in
        common CLI mode, using  'Content-Type:text/plain'.  Keep in mind that
        the used modules like  Net::SSLeay(1)  will write some debug messages
        on  STDERR instead  STDOUT.  Therefore multiple  --v  and/or  --trace
        options behave slightly different.

        No additional external files like  RC-FILE  or  DEBUG-FILE  are read
        in CGI mode; they are silently ignored.
        Some options are disabled in CGI mode  because they are dangerous  or
        don't make any sense.

      WARNING

          There are  no  input data validation checks implemented herein. All
          input data is url-decoded once and then used verbatim.
          More advanced checks must be done outside before calling this tool.

        It is not recommended to run this tool in CGI mode.
        You have been warned!

#       The only code necessary for CGI mode is encapsulated at the beginning,
#       see  'if ($me =~/\.cgi/){ ... }'.  Beside some minor additional regex
#       matches (mainly removing trailing   '=' and empty arguments) no other
#       code is needed.
#

    Using user specified code

        There are some functions called within the program flow, which can be
        filled with any perl code.  Empty stubs of the functions are prepared
        in  o-saft-usr.pm.  See also  USER-FILE .


DEBUG

    Debugging, Tracing

        Following  options and commands  are useful for hunting problems with
        SSL connections and/or this tool. Note that some options can be given
        multiple times to increase amount of listed information. Also keep in
        mind that it's best to specify  --v  as very first argument.

        Note that the file  o-saft-dbx.pm  is required,  if any  --trace*  or
        --v   option is used.

    Commands

        * +dump
        * +libversion
        * +s_client
        * +todo
        * +version

    Options

        * --v
        * --v--
        * --trace
        * --trace-arg
        * --trace-cmd
        * --trace-key

        Empty or undefined strings are written as  '<<undefined>>'  in texts.
        Some parameters, in particular those of  HTTP responses,  are written
        as  '<<response>>'.  Long parameter lists are abbreviated with '...'.

    Output

        When using  --v  and/or  --trace  options,  additional output will be
        prefixed with a  '#'  (mainly as first, left-most character.
        Following formats are used:

           #<space>
             Additional text for verbosity (--v options).

           #[variable name]<TAB>
             Internal variable name (--trace-key options).

           #o-saft.pl::
           #Net::SSLinfo::
             Trace information for --trace  options.

           #{
             Trace information from  NET::SSLinfo  for  --trace  options.
             These are data lines in the format:
              #{ variable name : value #}

             Note that 'value'  here can span multiple lines and ends with:
              #}

    Using outdated modules

        The tools was designed to work with old perl modules too.  When using
        old modules, a proper  '**WARNING:'  will be printed. These warinings
        cannot be switched of using  --no-warning  .
        The warning also informs about the missing functionality or check.

        I.g. it is best to install newer versions of the module if possible.
        A good practice to check if modules are available in a proper version
        is to call:

          $0 +version
          $0 +version --v --v

        Following example shows the result without warnings:

# TODO must be last section
TODO

#        openssl (nicht bei 0.9.8, bei 1.0.1*) -legacy_renegotiation
#        SSLCertScanner.exe http://www.xenarmor.com/network-ssl-certificate-scanner.php ansehen

        * new features
          ** client certificate
          ** some STRATTLS need : HELP STARTTLS HELP as output of HELPs are different
          ** support: PCT protocol
          ** Checking fallback from TLS 1.1 to TLS 1.0 (see ssl-cipher-check.pl)
          ** Minimal encryption strength: weak encryption (40-bit) (TestSSLServer.jar)
          ** check dynamic HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP)

        * missing checks
          ** SSL_honor_cipher_order => 1
          ** implement TLSv1.2 checks
          ** DNSEC and TLSA
          ** checkcert(): KeyUsage, keyCertSign, BasicConstraints
          ** DV and EV miss some minor checks; see checkdv() and checkev()
          ** +constraints does not check +constraints in the certificate of
             the certificate chain.
          ** TR-03116-4: does not check data in certificate chain
          ** RFC 7525: does not check data in certificate chain
          ** RFC 7525: 3.2.  Strict TLS (for STARTTLS)
          ** RFC 7525: 3.4.  TLS Session Resumption (session ticket must be
             authenticated and encrypted)
          ** RFC 7525: 3.6.  Server Name Indication (more reliable check)
          ** RFC 7525: 4.3.  Public Key Length (need more reliable check)
          ** RFC 7525: 6.2.  AES-GCM
          ** RFC 7525: 6.3.  Forward Secrecy
          ** RFC 7525: 6.4.  Diffie-Hellman Exponent Reuse

        * vulnerabilities
          ** Ticketbleed
          ** complete TIME, BREACH check
          ** BEAST more checks, see: http://www.bolet.org/TestSSLServer/

        * verify CA chain:
          ** Net::SSLinfo.pm implement verify*
          ** implement +check_chain (see Net::SSLinfo.pm implement verify* also)
          ** implement +ca = +verify +chain +rootcert +expired +fingerprint

        * postprocessing
          Remove all options for output formatting. Use a "postprocess" script
          instead.
          ** scoring
             implement score for PFS; lower score if not all ciphers support PFS
             make clear usage of score from %checks
          ** write postprocessor for tabular data, like
             ssl-cert-check -p 443 -s mail.google.com -i -V

        * Net::SSLeay
          ** remove all warn() as Net::SSLeay should be silent
          ** Net::SSLinfo.pm Net::SSLeay::ctrl()  sometimes fails, but doesn't
             return error message
          ** Net::SSLeay::CTX_clear_options()
             Need to check the difference between the  SSL_OP_LEGACY_SERVER_CONNECT  and
             SSL_OP_ALLOW_UNSAFE_LEGACY_RENEGOTIATION;  see also SSL_clear_options().
             see https://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_CTX_set_options.html
          ** Net::SSLeay::do_ssl_close()  does not realy work

        * Windows
          ** Unicode:
             try: cmd /K chcp 65001
             or:  chcp 65001
             or:  reg add hklm\system\currentcontrolset\control\nls\codepage -v oemcp -d 65001
          ** perl
             perl 5.10.x from PortableApps does not work, cause it misses
             IO/Socket/SSL.pm, however, checkAllCiphers.pl works.
             perl from older PortableApps/xampp (i.e. 1.7.x) does not work, cause
             IO/Socket/SSL.pm is too old (1.37).
          ** Windows
             on Windows print of strings > 32k does not work.
             Ugly workaround using --v implemented in o-saft-man.pm only.

        * internal
          ** use qr() for defining regex, see $cfg{'regex'}
          ** print_line() has ugly code for legacy=cipher
          ** "Label" texts are defined twice: o-saft.pl and Net::SSLeay
          ** make a clear concept how to handle +CMD whether they report
             checks or informations (aka %data vs. %check_*)
             currently (2016) each single command returns all values
          ** client certificates not yet implemented in _usesocket() _useopenssl(),
             see t.client-cert.txt
          ** (nicht wichtig, aber sauber programmieren)
             _get_default(): Net::SSLinfo::default() benutzen
